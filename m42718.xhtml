The fundamental process in creating previously unknown particles is to accelerate known particles, such as protons or electrons, and direct a beam of them toward a target. Collisions with target nuclei provide a wealth of information, such as information obtained by Rutherford using energetic helium nuclei from natural <math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>&#945;</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{&#945;} {}</annotation></semantics></math> radiation.

Limitations are placed on what can occur by known conservation laws, such as conservation of mass-energy, momentum, and charge. Even more interesting are the unknown limitations provided by nature. Some expected reactions do occur, while others do not, and still other unexpected reactions may appear. New laws are revealed, and the vast majority of what we know about particle physics has come from accelerator laboratories. It is the particle physicist&#8217;s favorite indoor sport, which is partly inspired by theory.</p><div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1169736995912">Early Accelerators</h1> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169738187415">An early accelerator is a relatively simple, large-scale version of the electron gun. The <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169738250297">Van de Graaff</span> (named after the Dutch physicist), which you have likely seen in physics demonstrations, is a small version of the ones used for nuclear research since their invention for that purpose in 1932. For more, see <a href="#import-auto-id1169737930527" data-target-id="import-auto-id1169737930527" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. These machines are electrostatic, creating potentials as great as 50 MV, and are used to accelerate a variety of nuclei for a range of experiments. Energies produced by Van de Graaffs are insufficient to produce new particles, but they have been instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus. Another, equally famous, early accelerator is the <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737755450">cyclotron</span>, invented in 1930 by the American physicist, E. O. Lawrence (1901&#8211;1958). For a visual representation with more detail, see <a href="#import-auto-id1169737931634" data-target-id="import-auto-id1169737931634" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. Cyclotrons use fixed-frequency alternating electric fields to accelerate particles. The particles spiral outward in a magnetic field, making increasingly larger radius orbits during acceleration. This clever arrangement allows the successive addition of electric potential energy and so greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff. Lawrence was involved in many early discoveries and in the promotion of physics programs in American universities. He was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for the cyclotron and nuclear activations, and he has an element and two major laboratories named for him.</p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169738110424">A <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737780196">synchrotron</span> is a version of a cyclotron in which the frequency of the alternating voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the beam particles are accelerated. Particles are made to travel the same distance in a shorter time with each cycle in fixed-radius orbits. A ring of magnets and accelerating tubes, as shown in <a href="#import-auto-id1169738243774" data-target-id="import-auto-id1169738243774" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, are the major components of synchrotrons. Accelerating voltages are synchronized (i.e., occur at the same time) with the particles to accelerate them, hence the name. Magnetic field strength is increased to keep the orbital radius constant as energy increases. High-energy particles require strong magnetic fields to steer them, so superconducting magnets are commonly employed. Still limited by achievable magnetic field strengths, synchrotrons need to be very large at very high energies, since the radius of a high-energy particle&#8217;s orbit is very large. Radiation caused by a magnetic field accelerating a charged particle perpendicular to its velocity is called <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169738048077">synchrotron radiation</span> in honor of its importance in these machines. Synchrotron radiation has a characteristic spectrum and polarization, and can be recognized in cosmic rays, implying large-scale magnetic fields acting on energetic and charged particles in deep space. Synchrotron radiation produced by accelerators is sometimes used as a source of intense energetic electromagnetic radiation for research purposes.</p> <figure id="import-auto-id1169737930527"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1169737804558" alt="The image shows a table-top-sized electrical machine.

Each major energy increase brought new information, sometimes producing spectacular progress, motivating the next step. One major innovation was driven by the desire to create more massive particles. Since momentum needs to be conserved in a collision, the particles created by a beam hitting a stationary target should recoil. This means that part of the energy input goes into recoil kinetic energy, significantly limiting the fraction of the beam energy that can be converted into new particles. One solution to this problem is to have head-on collisions between particles moving in opposite directions. <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737806444">Colliding beams</span> are made to meet head-on at points where massive detectors are located. Since the total incoming momentum is zero, it is possible to create particles with momenta and kinetic energies near zero. Particles with masses equivalent to twice the beam energy can thus be created. Another innovation is to create the antimatter counterpart of the beam particle, which thus has the opposite charge and circulates in the opposite direction in the same beam pipe.

Tube one is labeled plus, tube two is labeled minus, and tube three is labeled plus. An arrow labeled E points from tube one to tube two, and between these two tubes is a sphere labeled p plus. The third image is the same as the second, except that the tubes one, two, and three are labeled minus, plus, minus, respectively.

The frequency of the accelerating voltages is increased to cause the beam particles to travel the same distance in shorter time. The magnetic field should also be increased to keep each beam burst traveling in a fixed-radius path. Limits on magnetic field strength require these machines to be very large in order to accelerate particles to very high energies. (b) A positive particle is shown in the gap between accelerating tubes. (c) While the particle passes through the tube, the potentials are reversed so that there is another acceleration at the next gap. The frequency of the reversals needs to be varied as the particle is accelerated to achieve successive accelerations in each gap.</figcaption></figure></p> <figure id="import-auto-id1169737910424"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1169738249798" alt="On the left side of the image is a pair of equal-diameter, horizontal rings, with one labeled proton source and the other labeled anti proton source.

A section of hose tangentially leaves each ring to tangentially join another larger ring to the right, which is labeled main ring.

The now-canceled Superconducting Super Collider was being constructed in Texas with a design energy of 20 TeV to give a 40-TeV collision energy. It was to be an oval 30 km in diameter. Its cost as well as the politics of international research funding led to its demise.</p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169737768363">In addition to the large synchrotrons that produce colliding beams of protons and antiprotons, there are other large electron-positron accelerators.

Positrons created by the accelerator were brought to the same energy and collided with electrons in specially designed detectors. Linear accelerators use accelerating tubes similar to those in synchrotrons, but aligned in a straight line. This helps eliminate synchrotron radiation losses, which are particularly severe for electrons made to follow curved paths. CERN had an electron-positron collider appropriately called the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), which accelerated particles to 100 GeV and created a collision energy of 200 GeV. It was 8.5 km in diameter, while the SLAC machine was 3.2 km long.</p><figure id="import-auto-id1169738145188"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1169737933359" alt="The schematic shows a linear accelerator about three kilometers long with magnets along its path.
