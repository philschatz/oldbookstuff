From the incredibly short lifetime of a nucleus to the age of the Earth, from the tiny sizes of sub-nuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges of the known universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are enough factors of 10 to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values for physical quantities and equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more deeply than does qualitative description alone. To comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in which to express them. And we shall find that (even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds) a profound simplicity of nature appears&#8212;all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of only four fundamental physical quantities: length, mass, time, and electric current.</p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1675918">We define a <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1536256">physical quantity</span> either by <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">specifying how it is measured</em> or by <em class="emphasis" effect="italics"><em class="emphasis" effect="italics">stating how it is calculated</em></em> from other measurements. For example, we define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, whereas we define <em class="emphasis" effect="italics"><em class="emphasis" effect="italics">average speed</em></em> by stating that it is calculated as distance traveled divided by time of travel.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id2985261">Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1666000">units</span>, which are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way.

For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy and to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer due to very gradual slowing of the Earth&#8217;s rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very steady way, and these vibrations can be readily observed and counted. In 1967 the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 of these vibrations. (See <a href="#import-auto-id2575847" data-target-id="import-auto-id2575847" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>.)

The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar now kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter even more accurately in terms of the wavelength of light, so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition (partly for greater accuracy) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. (See <a href="#import-auto-id1381492" data-target-id="import-auto-id1381492" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>.) This change defines the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. The length of the meter will change if the speed of light is someday measured with greater accuracy.</p></div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id2786029">The Kilogram</h2> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id3204634">The SI unit for mass is the <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1989656">kilogram</span> (abbreviated kg); it is defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the standard kilogram are also kept at the United States&#8217; National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland outside of Washington D.C., and at other locations around the world. The determination of all other masses can be ultimately traced to a comparison with the standard mass.</p> <figure id="import-auto-id1381492"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id2509382" alt="Beam of light from a flashlight is represented by an arrow pointing right, traveling the length of a meter stick."> <img src="Figure_01_02_03a.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="400"/> </span> <figcaption>The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second in a vacuum.

The metric system is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations because the units are categorized by factors of 10. <a href="#import-auto-id2643474" data-target-id="import-auto-id2643474" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> gives metric prefixes and symbols used to denote various factors of 10.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1309728">Metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers of 10. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the system of U.S. customary units, the relationships are not as simple&#8212;there are 12 inches in a foot, 5280 feet in a mile, and so on. Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by using an appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction, while distances in kilometers are appropriate for air travel, and the tiny measure of nanometers are convenient in optical design. With the metric system there is no need to invent new units for particular applications.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1577727">The term <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1363292">order of magnitude</span> refers to the scale of a value expressed in the metric system.

There is a sense among physicists that, because there is an underlying microscopic substructure to matter, it would be most satisfying to base our standards of measurement on microscopic objects and fundamental physical phenomena such as the speed of light. A microscopic standard has been accomplished for the standard of time, which is based on the oscillations of the cesium atom.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id2596896">The standard for length was once based on the wavelength of light (a small-scale length) emitted by a certain type of atom, but it has been supplanted by the more precise measurement of the speed of light. If it becomes possible to measure the mass of atoms or a particular arrangement of atoms such as a silicon sphere to greater precision than the kilogram standard, it may become possible to base mass measurements on the small scale. There are also possibilities that electrical phenomena on the small scale may someday allow us to base a unit of charge on the charge of electrons and protons, but at present current and charge are related to large-scale currents and forces between wires.</p></div> <table id="import-auto-id2643474" summary="A table listing metric prefixes for powers of ten and their symbols.

For example, if you are reading a European cookbook, some quantities may be expressed in units of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or, perhaps you are reading walking directions from one location to another and you are interested in how many miles you will be walking. In this case, you will need to convert units of feet to miles.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1430021">Let us consider a simple example of how to convert units. Let us say that we want to convert 80 meters (m) to kilometers (km).</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1595008">The first thing to do is to list the units that you have and the units that you want to convert to. In this case, we have units in <em class="emphasis" effect="italics"><em class="emphasis" effect="italics">meters</em></em> and we want to convert to <em class="emphasis" effect="italics"><em class="emphasis" effect="italics">kilometers</em></em>.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id3083046">Next, we need to determine a <span class="term" id="import-auto-id2657858">conversion factor</span> relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there are 12 inches in 1 foot, 100 centimeters in 1 meter, 60 seconds in 1 minute, and so on. In this case, we know that there are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id2675967">Now we can set up our unit conversion.
