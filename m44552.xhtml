Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood. Since the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, the field of biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies. The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture (genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields). Biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels (<a href="/#fig-ch17_01_01ab" data-target-id="fig-ch17_01_01ab" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch17_01_01ab"><span class="media" id="fs-id2726785" alt="The left side of this image is an old black and white photo of a mailbox plastered with an advertisement reading &#8220;Penicillin cures gonorrhea in four hours.

The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated by exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling. The DNA can be replicated by the DNA polymerase enzyme. Unlike DNA, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the nucleus. The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-coding genes that are actively expressed. RNA molecules are very unstable compared with DNA molecules.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id2274690">DNA and RNA Extraction</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id2415311">To study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be isolated or extracted from the cells. Various techniques are used to extract different types of DNA (<a href="/#fig-ch17_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch17_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample). Cells are broken using a <span class="term">lysis buffer</span> (a solution which is mostly a detergent); lysis means &#8220;to split.&#8221; These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as <span class="term">proteases</span> that break down proteins, and <span class="term">ribonucleases</span> (RNAses) that break down RNA. The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol. Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous, white mass. The DNA samples can be stored frozen at &#8211;80&#176;C for several years.</p> <figure id="fig-ch17_01_02"><span class="media" id="fs-id2318009" alt="This illustration shows the four main steps of DNA extraction.

The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel. Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their size (<a href="/#fig-ch17_01_03" data-target-id="fig-ch17_01_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).

These bands are closely spaced toward the top, and spaced farther apart further down the gel. Lanes two through eight contain one or two bands each.

In step 1, the denaturation step, the sample is heated to a high temperature so the DNA strands separate. In step 2, annealing, the sample is cooled so two primers can anneal to the two strands of DNA. The primers are spaced such that the sequence of interest between them will be amplified. In step 3, DNA synthesis, the sample is warmed to the optimal temperature for Taq polymerase, which synthesizes the complementary strand from the primer to the 3' end of the molecule. This cycle is repeated again and again. Each time, the newly synthesized strands serve as templates so that the amount of DNA doubles with each cycle. As the cycles continue, more and more strands are the size of the distance between the two primers; in the end, the vast majority of strands are this size."> <img src="Figure_17_01_04.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="520"/> </span> <figcaption>Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to amplify a specific sequence of DNA.

A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a "folder" in which to insert a desired DNA fragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. In the bacterial context, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred to as <span class="term">foreign DNA</span>, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the <span class="term">host DNA</span>.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id960434">Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Escherichia coli</em>) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as <span class="term">antibiotic resistance</span> (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and human growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the <span class="term">multiple cloning site (MCS)</span>. The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases. <span class="term">Restriction endonucleases</span> recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, these are called &#8220;sticky ends.&#8221; Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds. In this way, any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease (<a href="/#fig-ch17_01_06" data-target-id="fig-ch17_01_06" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1772951">Recombinant DNA Molecules</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id2042376">Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called <span class="term">recombinant DNA</span> molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature.

The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene expression.

Within the lacZ gene are restriction sites, sequences of DNA cut by a particular restriction enzyme. The DNA to be cloned and the plasmid are both cut by the same restriction enzyme. The restriction enzyme staggers the cuts on the two strands of DNA, such that each strand has an overhanging single-stranded bit of DNA. On one strand, the sequence of the overhang is GATC, and on the other, the sequence is CTAG. These two sequences are complementary, and allow the fragment of foreign DNA to anneal with the plasmid. An enzyme called ligase joins the two pieces together. The ligated plasmid is then transformed into a bacterial strain that lacks the lacZ gene and is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. The bacteria are plated on media containing ampicillin, so that only bacteria that have taking up the plasmid (which has an ampicillin resistance gene) will grow. The media also contains X-gal, a chemical that is metabolized in the same way as lactose. Plasmids lacking the insert are able to metabolize X-gal, releasing a dye from X-gal that turns the colony blue. Plasmids with the insert have a disrupted lacZ gene and produce white colonies.

Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2100688">Parthenogenesis, or &#8220;virgin birth,&#8221; occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1235778">Sexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id843472">The first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996.

Since Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism).

Genes cloned from the influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id944574">Antibiotics are a biotechnological product. They are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an advantage over bacterial populations. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1942719">Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">E. coli</em> as early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of differences in the gene product. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders in children.

For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. Animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called transgenic animals. Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats, and some are expressed in the eggs of chickens. Mice have been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of recombinant genes and mutations.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1961722">Transgenic Plants</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1519760">Manipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (<a href="/#fig-ch17_01_09" data-target-id="fig-ch17_01_09" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).

Because they are not natural, transgenic plants and other GMOs are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants to be genetically engineered.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1280120">Transformation of Plants Using <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em></h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1812768">Gene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. Many viruses that cause human diseases, such as cancer, act by incorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused by the bacterium <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em> occur by transfer of DNA from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they make the plants stunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. Many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets, are affected by <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">A. tumefaciens</em>. The artificial introduction of DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell wall.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id3332735">Researchers used the natural transfer of DNA from <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Agrobacterium</em> to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice into plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">A. tumefaciens</em> have a set of plasmids, called the <span class="term">Ti plasmids</span> (tumor-inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell&#8217;s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the desired DNA fragment for transfer into the plant genome. The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection and can be propagated in <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">E. coli</em> cells as well.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1384948">The Organic Insecticide <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Bacillus thuringiensis</em></h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1270917"><em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Bacillus thuringiensis</em> (Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect species that affect plants. Bt toxin has to be ingested by insects for the toxin to be activated. Insects that have eaten Bt toxin stop feeding on the plants within a few hours. After the toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within a couple of days. Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects. The crystal toxin genes have been cloned from Bt and introduced into plants. Bt toxin has been found to be safe for the environment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1386358">Flavr Savr Tomato</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1453957">The first GM crop to be introduced into the market was the Flavr Savr Tomato produced in 1994. Antisense RNA technology was used to slow down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections, which led to increased shelf life of the GM tomatoes. Additional genetic modification improved the flavor of this tomato. The Flavr Savr tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and shipping the crop.</p> </div> </div> <div class="summary section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1047517">Section Summary</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id2888326">Nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the purposes of further analysis by breaking open the cells and enzymatically destroying all other major macromolecules.
