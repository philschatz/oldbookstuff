A group of materials made from the alloys of the rare earth elements are also used as strong and permanent magnets; a popular one is neodymium.

The first significant observation was by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777&#8211;1851), who found that a compass needle was deflected by a current-carrying wire. This was the first significant evidence that the movement of charges had any connection with magnets. <span class="term" id="import-auto-id2206858">Electromagnetism</span> is the use of electric current to make magnets. These temporarily induced magnets are called <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1476064">electromagnets</span>.

(See <a href="#import-auto-id2579978" data-target-id="import-auto-id2579978" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>.) Whenever strong magnetic effects are needed, such as lifting scrap metal, or in particle accelerators, electromagnets are enhanced by ferromagnetic materials. Limits to how strong the magnets can be made are imposed by coil resistance (it will overheat and melt at sufficiently high current), and so superconducting magnets may be employed. These are still limited, because superconducting properties are destroyed by too great a magnetic field.</p> <figure id="import-auto-id2579978"><figcaption>An electromagnet with a ferromagnetic core can produce very strong magnetic effects.

In later sections we explore this more quantitatively, finding the strength and direction of magnetic fields created by various currents. But what about ferromagnets? <a href="#import-auto-id2071727" data-target-id="import-auto-id2071727" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> shows models of how electric currents create magnetism at the submicroscopic level. (Note that we cannot directly observe the paths of individual electrons about atoms, and so a model or visual image, consistent with all direct observations, is made. We can directly observe the electron&#8217;s orbital angular momentum, its spin momentum, and subsequent magnetic moments, all of which are explained with electric-current-creating subatomic magnetism.) Currents, including those associated with other submicroscopic particles like protons, allow us to explain ferromagnetism and all other magnetic effects. Ferromagnetism, for example, results from an internal cooperative alignment of electron spins, possible in some materials but not in others.</p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1564818">Crucial to the statement that electric current is the source of all magnetism is the fact that it is impossible to separate north and south magnetic poles. (This is far different from the case of positive and negative charges, which are easily separated.) A current loop always produces a magnetic dipole&#8212;that is, a magnetic field that acts like a north pole and south pole pair. Since isolated north and south magnetic poles, called <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1524979">magnetic monopoles</span>, are not observed, currents are used to explain all magnetic effects. If magnetic monopoles did exist, then we would have to modify this underlying connection that all magnetism is due to electrical current. There is no known reason that magnetic monopoles should not exist&#8212;they are simply never observed&#8212;and so searches at the subnuclear level continue. If they do <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">not</em> exist, we would like to find out why not.
