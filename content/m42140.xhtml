Its wheels also spin rapidly&#x2014;the latter completing many revolutions, the former only part of one (a circular arc). The same physical principles are involved in each.

    >Many motions, such as the arc of a bird&#x2019;s flight or Earth&#x2019;s path around the Sun, are curved. Recall that Newton&#x2019;s first law tells us that motion is along a straight line at constant speed unless there is a net external force. We will therefore study not only motion along curves, but also the forces that cause it, including gravitational forces. In some ways, this chapter is a continuation of <a
