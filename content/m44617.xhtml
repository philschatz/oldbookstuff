Moreover, protists that exhibit similar morphological features may have evolved analogous structures because of similar selective pressures&#8212;rather than because of recent common ancestry. This phenomenon, called convergent evolution, is one reason why protist classification is so challenging. The emerging classification scheme groups the entire domain Eukaryota into six &#8220;supergroups&#8221; that contain all of the protists as well as animals, plants, and fungi that evolved from a common ancestor (<a href="/#fig-ch23_03_01" data-target-id="fig-ch23_03_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). The supergroups are believed to be monophyletic, meaning that all organisms within each supergroup are believed to have evolved from a single common ancestor, and thus all members are most closely related to each other than to organisms outside that group. There is still evidence lacking for the monophyly of some groups.</p> <figure id="fig-ch23_03_01" data-class=" "><figcaption>This diagram shows a proposed classification of the domain Eukara.

Giant kelps are a type of brown algae. Some brown algae have evolved specialized tissues that resemble terrestrial plants, with root-like holdfasts, stem-like stipes, and leaf-like blades that are capable of photosynthesis. The stipes of giant kelps are enormous, extending in some cases for 60 meters. A variety of algal life cycles exists, but the most complex is alternation of generations, in which both haploid and diploid stages involve multicellularity. Compare this life cycle to that of humans, for instance. Haploid gametes produced by meiosis (sperm and egg) combine in fertilization to generate a diploid zygote that undergoes many rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular embryo and then a fetus. However, the individual sperm and egg themselves never become multicellular beings. Terrestrial plants also have evolved alternation of generations. In the brown algae genus <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Laminaria</em>, haploid spores develop into multicellular gametophytes, which produce haploid gametes that combine to produce diploid organisms that then become multicellular organisms with a different structure from the haploid form (<a href="/#fig-ch23_03_11" data-target-id="fig-ch23_03_11" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).
