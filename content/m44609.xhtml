Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems, with atmospheric nitrogen, N<sub class="sub">2</sub>, providing the largest pool of available nitrogen. However, eukaryotes cannot use atmospheric, gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules. Fortunately, nitrogen can be &#8220;fixed,&#8221; meaning it is converted into ammonia (NH<sub class="sub">3</sub>) either biologically or abiotically. Abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of lightning or by industrial processes.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp136134416"><span class="term">Biological nitrogen fixation</span> (BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, and <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Frankia</em> spp. (filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern). After photosynthesis, BNF is the second most important biological process on Earth. The equation representing the process is as follows</p> <div class="equation" id="eip-324"> <math data-display="block"> <mrow> <msub> <mtext>N</mtext> <mn>2</mn> </msub> <msup> <mrow> <mtext>&#160;+&#160;16ATP&#160;+&#160;8e</mtext> </mrow> <mo>&#8722;</mo> </msup> <msup> <mrow> <mtext>&#160;+&#160;8H</mtext> </mrow> <mo>+</mo> </msup> <mtext>&#160;</mtext><mo stretchy="false">&#8594;</mo><msub> <mrow> <mtext>&#160;2NH</mtext> </mrow> <mn>3</mn> </msub> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>&#160;+&#160;16ADP&#160;+&#160;16Pi&#160;+&#160;H</mtext> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msub> </mrow> </math></div><p class="para" id="fs-idp28467808">where Pi stands for inorganic phosphate. The total fixed nitrogen through BNF is about 100 to 180 million metric tons per year. Biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp165163504">Cyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments. In soil, members of the genus <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Clostridium</em> are examples of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Other bacteria live symbiotically with legume plants, providing the most important source of BNF. Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free-living organisms by a factor of 10. Soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form <span class="term">nodules</span>, specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs (<a href="/#fig-ch22_05_01" data-target-id="fig-ch22_05_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes nitrogen, is inactivated by oxygen, so the nodule provides an oxygen-free area for nitrogen fixation to take place. This process provides a natural and inexpensive plant fertilizer, as it reduces atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which is easily usable by plants. The use of&#160;legumes is an excellent alternative to&#160;chemical fertilization and is of special&#160;interest to sustainable agriculture, which seeks to minimize the&#160;use of chemicals and conserve natural resources. Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen: the atmosphere. Bacteria benefit from using photosynthates (carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis) from the plant and having a protected niche. Additionally, the soil benefits from being naturally fertilized. Therefore, the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice.</p><p class="para" id="fs-idm61079952">Why are legumes so important?

Evidence indicates that the Sumerians discovered fermentation by chance.&#160;Wine has been produced for about 4,500 years, and evidence suggests that cultured milk products, like yogurt, have existed for at least 4,000 years.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp44601808">Using Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet: Bioremediation</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm36174032">Microbial <span class="term">bioremediation</span> is the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants. Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface. Certain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation. The reduction of SeO<sub class="sub">4</sub><sup class="sup">-2</sup> to SeO<sub class="sub">3</sub><sup class="sup">-2</sup> and to Se<sup class="sup">0</sup> (metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water. Mercury is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. As an active ingredient of some pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes, such as battery production. Methyl mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These bacteria, such as <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, can convert Hg<sup class="sup">+2</sup> into Hg<sup class="sup">0</sup>, which is nontoxic to humans.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp21794192">One of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills. The importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (<a href="/#fig-ch22_05_03" data-target-id="fig-ch22_05_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the Mediterranean from a Lebanon power plant (2006), and more recently, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (2010). To clean up these spills, bioremediation is promoted by the addition of inorganic nutrients that help bacteria to grow. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking down the hydrocarbons. Some species, such as <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Alcanivorax borkumensis</em>, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil, whereas other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide. In the case of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill. In addition to naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria, humans select and engineer bacteria that possess the same capability with increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon compounds that can be processed. Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within one year of the spill. Other oil fractions containing aromatic and highly branched hydrocarbon chains are more difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer periods of time.</p> <figure id="fig-ch22_05_03"><figcaption>(a) Cleaning up oil after the Valdez spill in Alaska, workers hosed oil from beaches and then used a floating boom to corral the oil, which was finally skimmed from the water surface.

More recently, scientists have gathered evidence that these bacteria may also help regulate our moods, influence our activity levels, and even help control weight by affecting our food choices and absorption patterns. The Human Microbiome Project has begun the process of cataloging our normal bacteria (and archaea) so we can better understand these functions.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp48752928">A particularly fascinating example of our normal flora relates to our digestive systems.
