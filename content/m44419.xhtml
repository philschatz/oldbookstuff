Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.</p><div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1967798">Endocytosis</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1416306"><span class="term">Endocytosis</span> is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a cell. There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: The plasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle being contained in a newly created intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma membrane.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1242559">Phagocytosis</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1694237">Phagocytosis (the condition of &#8220;cell eating&#8221;) is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles, are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (<a href="/#fig-ch05_04_01" data-target-id="fig-ch05_04_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch05_04_01"><figcaption>In phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the particle and engulfs it.

The coated portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. Once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for the breakdown of the material in the newly formed compartment (endosome). When accessible nutrients from the degradation of the vesicular contents have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid. The endosomal membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1434270">Pinocytosis</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id2337777">A variation of endocytosis is called <span class="term">pinocytosis</span>. This literally means &#8220;cell drinking&#8221; and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome (<a href="/#fig-ch05_04_02" data-target-id="fig-ch05_04_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch05_04_02"><figcaption>In pinocytosis, the cell membrane invaginates, surrounds a small volume of fluid, and pinches off.

This process uses a coating protein, called <span class="term">caveolin</span>, on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which performs a similar function to clathrin. The cavities in the plasma membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin. The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae (singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis. Potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to transport these molecules through the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id2059707">Receptor-mediated Endocytosis</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id2163521">A targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity for certain substances (<a href="/#fig-ch05_04_03" data-target-id="fig-ch05_04_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch05_04_03"><figcaption>In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted to a single type of substance that binds to the receptor on the external surface of the cell membrane.

If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2074680">Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-id2000637" data-class="interactive"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-id2023248" data-alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="endocytosis.png" data-mime-type="image/png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="130"/></span> <p class="para" id="fs-id2292278">See receptor-mediated endocytosis in action, and click on different <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/endocytosis" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/endocytosis">parts</a> for a focused animation.</p> </div></div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1836379">Exocytosis</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id841051">The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. <span class="term">Exocytosis</span> is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane.

Large particles, such as macromolecules, parts of cells, or whole cells, can be engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis. In phagocytosis, a portion of the membrane invaginates and flows around the particle, eventually pinching off and leaving the particle entirely enclosed by an envelope of plasma membrane. Vesicle contents are broken down by the cell, with the particles either used as food or dispatched. Pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller scale. The plasma membrane invaginates and pinches off, producing a small envelope of fluid from outside the cell. Pinocytosis imports substances that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. The cell expels waste in a similar but reverse manner: it pushes a membranous vacuole to the plasma membrane, allowing the vacuole to fuse with the membrane and incorporate itself into the membrane structure, releasing its contents to the exterior.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1302123">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1853625"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2197804"><p class="para" id="fs-id1255097">What happens to the membrane of a vesicle after exocytosis?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1712549" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">It leaves the cell.</li> <li class="item">It is disassembled by the cell.</li> <li class="item">It fuses with and becomes part of the plasma membrane.</li> <li class="item">It is used again in another exocytosis event.</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1778503"> <p class="para" id="fs-id2197192">C</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2116533"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1723512"><p class="para" id="fs-id1981380">Which transport mechanism can bring whole cells into a cell?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1896127" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">pinocytosis</li> <li class="item">phagocytosis</li> <li class="item">facilitated transport</li> <li class="item">primary active transport</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2051644"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1439092">B</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1702994"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1772017"><p class="para" id="fs-id2215844">In what important way does receptor-mediated endocytosis differ from phagocytosis?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1481792" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">It transports only small amounts of fluid.</li> <li class="item">It does not involve the pinching off of membrane.</li> <li class="item">It brings in only a specifically targeted substance.</li> <li class="item">It brings substances into the cell, while phagocytosis removes substances.</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1443204"> <p class="para" id="fs-id2000022">C</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1419827">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1415018"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2013541"><p class="para" id="fs-id1787601">Why is it important that there are different types of proteins in plasma membranes for the transport of materials into and out of a cell?</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1693578"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1768554">The proteins allow a cell to select what compound will be transported, meeting the needs of the cell and not bringing in anything else.</p></div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1982720"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1481453"><p class="para" id="fs-id1760853">Why do ions have a difficult time getting through plasma membranes despite their small size?</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1236377"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1805576">Ions are charged, and consequently, they are hydrophilic and cannot associate with the lipid portion of the membrane.
