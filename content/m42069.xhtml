      >force</span
    >&#x2014;that is, a push or a pull&#x2014;is a good place to start. We know that a push or pull has both magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity) and can vary considerably in each regard. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth exerts only a tiny downward pull on a flea. Our everyday experiences also give us a good idea of how multiple forces add. If two people push in different directions on a third person, as illustrated in <a
        href="#import-auto-id2379809"
        class="autogenerated-content"
      >[link]</a
    >, we might expect the total force to be in the direction shown. Since force is a vector, it adds just like other vectors, as illustrated in <a
        href="#import-auto-id2379809"
        class="autogenerated-content"
      >[link]</a
    >(a) for two ice skaters. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can be added using the familiar head-to-tail method or by trigonometric methods. These ideas were developed in <a

We can ignore any internal forces within the body.)

    >A more quantitative definition of force can be based on some standard force, just as distance is measured in units relative to a standard distance. One possibility is to stretch a spring a certain fixed distance, as illustrated in <a
        href="#import-auto-id2608835"

      >restoring force</em

        href="/m42365"
      >Magnetism</a
    > is the magnetic force between two wires carrying electric current.) Some alternative definitions of force will be given later in this chapter.</p

Find a small household item that could be attached to the rubber band using a paper clip, and use this item as a weight to investigate the stretch of the rubber band. Measure the amount of stretch produced in the rubber band with one, two, and four of these (identical) items suspended from the rubber band. What is the relationship between the number of items and the amount of stretch? How large a stretch would you expect for the same number of items suspended from two rubber bands? What happens to the amount of stretch of the rubber band (with the weights attached) if the weights are also pushed to the side with a pencil? </p
