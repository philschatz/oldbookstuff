However, consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input, because their products have more free energy than their reactants. Within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from? The answer lies with an energy-supplying molecule called <span class="term">adenosine triphosphate</span>, or <span class="term">ATP</span>. ATP is a small, relatively simple molecule (<a href="/#fig-ch06_04_01" data-target-id="fig-ch06_04_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>), but within some of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work. This molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in much the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need. ATP is used to power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.</p> <figure id="fig-ch06_04_01"><figcaption>ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell.

Adenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a five-carbon sugar, ribose. The three phosphate groups, in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar, are labeled alpha, beta, and gamma. Together, these chemical groups constitute an energy powerhouse. However, not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy state. Both bonds that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds (<span class="term">phosphoanhydride bonds</span>) that, when broken, release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes. These high-energy bonds are the bonds between the second and third (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups. The reason that these bonds are considered &#8220;high-energy&#8221; is because the products of such bond breaking&#8212;adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group (P<sub class="sub">i</sub>)&#8212;have considerably lower free energy than the reactants: ATP and a water molecule. Because this reaction takes place with the use of a water molecule, it is considered a hydrolysis reaction. In other words, ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP in the following reaction:</p> <div class="equation" id="eip-628"><math data-display="block"><semantics> <mrow> <mtext>ATP</mtext><mo>+</mo><msub> <mtext>H</mtext> <mtext>2</mtext> </msub> <mtext>O</mtext><mo stretchy="false">&#8594;</mo><mtext>ADP</mtext><mo>+</mo><msub> <mtext>P</mtext> <mtext>i</mtext> </msub> <mo>+</mo><mtext>free energy</mtext> </mrow> <annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">size 12{{ATP} + H rSub { size 8{2} } O ADP + P rSub { size 8{i}} + {free energy} } {}</annotation></semantics></math></div><p class="para" id="fs-id1477773">Like most chemical reactions, the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is reversible. The reverse reaction regenerates ATP from ADP + P<sub class="sub">i</sub>. Indeed, cells rely on the regeneration of ATP just as people rely on the regeneration of spent money through some sort of income. Since ATP hydrolysis releases energy, ATP regeneration must require an input of free energy. The formation of ATP is expressed in this equation:</p> <div class="equation" id="eip-976"><math data-display="block"><semantics> <mrow> <mtext>ADP</mtext><mo>+</mo><msub> <mtext>P</mtext> <mtext>i</mtext> </msub> <mo>+</mo><mtext>free&#160;energy</mtext><mo stretchy="false">&#8594;</mo><mtext>ATP</mtext><mo>+</mo><msub> <mtext>H</mtext> <mtext>2</mtext> </msub> <mtext>O</mtext> </mrow> <annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">size 12{{ATP} + H rSub { size 8{2} } O ADP + P rSub { size 8{i}} + {free energy} } {}</annotation></semantics></math></div><p class="para" id="fs-id1780567">Two prominent questions remain with regard to the use of ATP as an energy source. Exactly how much free energy is released with the hydrolysis of ATP, and how is that free energy used to do cellular work? The calculated &#8710;G for the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP into ADP and P<sub class="sub">i</sub> is &#8722;7.3 kcal/mole (&#8722;30.5 kJ/mol). Since this calculation is true under standard conditions, it would be expected that a different value exists under cellular conditions. In fact, the &#8710;G for the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP in a living cell is almost double the value at standard conditions: 14 kcal/mol (&#8722;57 kJ/mol).</p><p class="para" id="fs-id2018833">ATP is a highly unstable molecule. Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously dissociates into ADP + P<sub class="sub">i</sub>, and the free energy released during this process is lost as heat. The second question posed above, that is, how the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is used to perform work inside the cell, depends on a strategy called energy coupling. Cells couple the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, allowing them to proceed. One example of energy coupling using ATP involves a transmembrane ion pump that is extremely important for cellular function. This sodium-potassium pump (Na<sup class="sup">+</sup>/K<sup class="sup">+</sup> pump) drives sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell (<a href="/#fig-ch06_04_02" data-target-id="fig-ch06_04_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). A large percentage of a cell&#8217;s ATP is spent powering this pump, because cellular processes bring a great deal of sodium into the cell and potassium out of the cell. The pump works constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations of sodium and potassium. In order for the pump to turn one cycle (exporting three Na+ ions and importing two K<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions), one molecule of ATP must be hydrolyzed. When ATP is hydrolyzed, its gamma phosphate doesn&#8217;t simply float away, but is actually transferred onto the pump protein. This process of a phosphate group binding to a molecule is called phosphorylation. As with most cases of ATP hydrolysis, a phosphate from ATP is transferred onto another molecule. In a phosphorylated state, the Na<sup class="sup">+</sup>/K<sup class="sup">+</sup> pump has more free energy and is triggered to undergo a conformational change. This change allows it to release Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> to the outside of the cell. It then binds extracellular K<sup class="sup">+</sup>, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate to detach from the pump. This release of phosphate triggers the K<sup class="sup">+</sup> to be released to the inside of the cell. Essentially, the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with the energy required to power the pump and transport Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> and K<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions. ATP performs cellular work using this basic form of energy coupling through phosphorylation.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-id2581828" data-class="art-connection"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Art Connection</div> <p class="para" id="fs-id1704937"><figure id="fig-ch06_04_02"><figcaption>The sodium-potassium pump is an example of energy coupling.

One example is during the very first steps of cellular respiration, when a molecule of the sugar glucose is broken down in the process of glycolysis. In the first step of this process, ATP is required for the phosphorylation of glucose, creating a high-energy but unstable intermediate. This phosphorylation reaction powers a conformational change that allows the phosphorylated glucose molecule to be converted to the phosphorylated sugar fructose. Fructose is a necessary intermediate for glycolysis to move forward. Here, the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled with the endergonic reaction of converting glucose into a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway. Once again, the energy released by breaking a phosphate bond within ATP was used for the phosphorylation of another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate and powering an important conformational change.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-id1422276" data-class="interactive"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-id2322522" data-alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="glycolysis_stgs.png" data-mime-type="image/png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="130"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-id2258341">See an interactive animation of the ATP-producing glycolysis process at this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/glycolysis_stgs" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/glycolysis_stgs">site</a>.</p> </div><div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id782682">Section Summary</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1423640">ATP is the primary energy-supplying molecule for living cells.

Cells use ATP to perform work by coupling the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions. ATP donates its phosphate group to another molecule via a process known as phosphorylation.
