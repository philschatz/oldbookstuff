    >What might desks, bridges, buildings, trees, and mountains have in common&#x2014;at least in the eyes of a physicist? The answer is that they are ordinarily motionless relative to the Earth. Furthermore, their acceleration is zero because they remain motionless. That means they also have something in common with a car moving at a constant velocity, because anything with a constant velocity also has an acceleration of zero. Now, the important part&#x2014;Newton&#x2019;s second law states that net <math
