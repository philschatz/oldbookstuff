There are many different environments on Earth with various energy and carbon sources, and variable conditions. Prokaryotes have been able to live in every environment by using whatever energy and carbon sources are available. Prokaryotes fill many niches on Earth, including being involved in nutrient cycles such as nitrogen and carbon cycles, decomposing dead organisms, and thriving inside living organisms, including humans. The very broad range of environments that prokaryotes occupy is possible because they have diverse metabolic processes.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp154343472">Needs of Prokaryotes</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp58811600">The diverse environments and ecosystems on Earth have a wide range of conditions in terms of temperature, available nutrients, acidity, salinity, and energy sources. Prokaryotes are very well equipped to make their living out of a vast array of nutrients and conditions. To live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some additional nutrients.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp69108640">Macronutrients</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm31669472">Cells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water. Recall that macromolecules are produced by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers. For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they need certain substances, collectively called <span class="term">nutrients</span>. When prokaryotes grow in nature, they obtain their nutrients from the environment. Nutrients that are required in large amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in smaller or trace amounts are called micronutrients. Just a handful of elements are considered macronutrients&#8212;carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. (A mnemonic for remembering these elements is the acronym <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">CHONPS</em>.)</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp12908480">Why are these macronutrients needed in large amounts? They are the components of organic compounds in cells, including water. Carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other compounds. Carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell. Nitrogen represents 12 percent of the total dry weight of a typical cell and is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents. Most of the nitrogen available in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub class="sub">2</sub>) or another inorganic form. Diatomic (N<sub class="sub">2</sub>) nitrogen, however, can be converted into an organic form only by certain organisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms. Both hydrogen and oxygen are part of many organic compounds and of water. Phosphorus is required by all organisms for the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. Sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methionine, and is also present in several vitamins and coenzymes. Other important macronutrients are potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the structure and function of the prokaryotic cell.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp74490048">Micronutrients</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm32094128">In addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts. These are referred to as micronutrients or trace elements. For example, iron is necessary for the function of the cytochromes involved in electron-transport reactions. Some prokaryotes require other metallic elements&#8212;such as boron (B), chromium (Cr), and manganese (Mn)&#8212;primarily as enzyme cofactors.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp2944480">The Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Energy</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm8743200">Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules. <span class="term">Phototrophs</span> (or phototrophic organisms) obtain their energy from sunlight. <span class="term">Chemotrophs</span> (or chemosynthetic organisms) obtain their energy from chemical compounds. Chemotrophs that can use organic compounds as energy sources are called chemoorganotrophs. Those that can also use inorganic compounds as energy sources are called chemolitotrophs.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp3324256">The Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Carbon</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idp36184192">Prokaryotes not only can use different sources of energy but also different sources of carbon compounds. Recall that organisms that are able to fix inorganic carbon are called autotrophs. Autotrophic prokaryotes synthesize organic molecules from carbon dioxide. In contrast, heterotrophic prokaryotes obtain carbon from organic compounds. To make the picture more complex, the terms that describe how prokaryotes obtain energy and carbon can be combined. Thus, photoautotrophs use energy from sunlight, and carbon from carbon dioxide and water, whereas chemoheterotrophs obtain energy and carbon from an organic chemical source. Chemolitoautotrophs obtain their energy from inorganic compounds, and they build their complex molecules from carbon dioxide.

Prokaryotes play many roles in the environments they occupy. The roles they play in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are vital to life on Earth.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idm18679632">Prokaryotes and the Carbon Cycle</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idp132815728">Carbon is one of the most important macronutrients, and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle (<a href="/#fig-ch22_03_01" data-target-id="fig-ch22_03_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Carbon is cycled through Earth&#8217;s major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks, and biomass. The movement of carbon is via carbon dioxide, which is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and marine prokaryotes, and is returned to the atmosphere via the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including prokaryotes, fungi, and animals. Although the largest carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments, that carbon is not readily available.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm48166784">A large amount of available carbon is found in land plants. Plants, which are producers, use carbon dioxide from the air to synthesize carbon compounds. Related to this, one very significant source of carbon compounds is humus, which is a mixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition. Consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Then, bacteria and fungi, collectively called <span class="term">decomposers</span>, carry out the breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic compounds. The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material (dead animals, plants, and humus) that undergo respiration.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp54591920">In aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place. In this case, the cycle is based on one-carbon compounds. In anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (CH<sub class="sub">4</sub>). This methane moves into the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria called methane oxidizers that oxidize methane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere.</p> <figure id="fig-ch22_03_01" data-class=" "><figcaption>Prokaryotes play a significant role in continuously moving carbon through the biosphere.

It is a macronutrient, and in nature, it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrate, nitrite, and nitrogen gas by myriad processes, many of which are carried out by prokaryotes. As illustrated in Figure B22_03_02, prokaryotes are key to the nitrogen cycle. The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air, but this nitrogen is not usable by plants, which are primary producers. Gaseous nitrogen is transformed, or &#8220;fixed&#8221; into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of <span class="term">nitrogen fixation</span>. Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp50138704">Another source of ammonia is <span class="term">ammonification</span>, the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. Ammonia released to the atmosphere, however, represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released; the rest is as N<sub class="sub">2</sub> and N<sub class="sub">2</sub>O.
