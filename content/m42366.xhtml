      >The Earth acts like a very large bar magnet with its south-seeking pole near the geographic North Pole. That is why the north pole of your compass is attracted toward the geographic north pole of the Earth&#x2014;because the magnetic pole that is near the geographic North Pole is actually a south magnetic pole! Confusion arises because the geographic term &#x201C;North Pole&#x201D; has come to be used (incorrectly) for the magnetic pole that is near the North Pole. Thus, &#x201C;North magnetic pole&#x201D; is actually a misnomer&#x2014;it should be called the South magnetic pole.</p
