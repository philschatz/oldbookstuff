In addition, a constant force applied to a critically damped system moves the system to a new equilibrium position in the shortest time possible without overshooting or oscillating about the new position. For example, when you stand on bathroom scales that have a needle gauge, the needle moves to its equilibrium position without oscillating. It would be quite inconvenient if the needle oscillated about the new equilibrium position for a long time before settling. Damping forces can vary greatly in character. Friction, for example, is sometimes independent of velocity (as assumed in most places in this text). But many damping forces depend on velocity&#8212;sometimes in complex ways, sometimes simply being proportional to velocity.</p> <div class="example" id="fs-id1427684"><div class="title">Damping an Oscillatory Motion: Friction on an Object Connected to a Spring</div><p class="para" id="import-auto-id3013339">Damping oscillatory motion is important in many systems, and the ability to control the damping is even more so.

The first step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The second step is to solve for the unknowns using familiar problem-solving strategies. These are found throughout the text, and many worked examples show how to use them for single topics. In this integrated concepts example, you can see how to apply them across several topics. You will find these techniques useful in applications of physics outside a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life.</p> </div><div class="exercise" id="fs-id3256580" data-type="check-understanding"> <div class="title"><span class="label"/>Check Your Understanding</div> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1945379"><p class="para" id="import-auto-id3013679">Why are completely undamped harmonic oscillators so rare?</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2407944" print-placement="here"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1947564">Friction often comes into play whenever an object is moving.
