Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and interpret entire genomes.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1378525">For example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, only the coding, exon-producing regions of the DNA are sequenced. In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, whole-exome sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone-marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the first person to be successfully treated based on a diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing. Today, human genome sequencing is more readily available and can be completed in a day or two for about $1000.</p><div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1728058">Strategies Used in Sequencing Projects</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1506481">The basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the dideoxy method), which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular <span class="term">deoxynucleotide</span> (dNTP), which is a monomer, or a single unit, of DNA. The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled <span class="term">dideoxynucleotides</span> (ddNTPs). The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (&#8211;OH) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain (<a href="/#fig-ch17_03_01" data-target-id="fig-ch17_03_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Each ddNTP is labeled with a different color of fluorophore. Every time a ddNTP is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of DNA replication, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA that are each terminated at a different point during replication. When the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis after being separated into single strands, the multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. Because the ddNTPs are fluorescently labeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the DNA strand and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction. The different colors of the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position. Reading the gel on the basis of the color of each band on the ladder produces the sequence of the template strand (<a href="/#fig-ch17_03_02" data-target-id="fig-ch17_03_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch17_03_01"><figcaption>A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is missing the 3' hydroxyl group (indicated by the box).

This was the first strategy used to sequence large DNA fragments, which eventually led to whole-genome sequencing. In the shotgun sequencing method, DNA is fragmented into small pieces and then sequenced multiple times by the chain termination method. Overlapping sequences help to piece together fragments in the correct order to get the sequence of a large piece of DNA. A <span class="term">contig</span> is a larger sequence assembled from overlapping shorter sequences. Each sequencing run provides a sequence of 500 to 1000 base pairs starting from each end. The sequence between the ends is deciphered from overlapping clones using PCR amplification, recloning, and sequencing. This technique seems more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the pieces because there is more available information.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id2590205">Next-generation Sequencing</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id2590614">Since 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of <span class="term">next-generation sequencing</span>, which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day. These sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-id2763612" data-class="evolution"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Evolution Connection</div> <p class="para" id="fs-id1244071"><span class="title">Comparing Sequences</span>A sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA; it is used to identify regions of similarity between cell types or species, which may indicate conservation of function or structures.

Several other organelle and viral genomes were later sequenced. The first organism whose genome was sequenced was the bacterium <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Haemophilus influenzae</em>; this was accomplished by Craig Venter in the 1980s. Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on the sequencing of the genome of the yeast <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, which began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome that had been sequenced. By 1997, the genome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacterium <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Escherichia coli</em> K12 and the yeast <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>. Genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Mus musculus</em>, the fruit fly <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Drosophila melanogaster</em>, the nematode <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Caenorhabditis. elegans</em>, and humans <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Homo sapiens</em> are now known. A lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms. A <span class="term">model organism</span> is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms. The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called <span class="term">genome annotation</span>.

Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays, whereas whole-genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome. Although the study of medical applications of genome sequencing is interesting, this discipline tends to dwell on abnormal gene function. Knowledge of the entire genome will allow future onset diseases and other genetic disorders to be discovered early, which will allow for more informed decisions to be made about lifestyle, medication, and having children. Genomics is still in its infancy, although someday it may become routine to use whole-genome sequencing to screen every newborn to detect genetic abnormalities.</p><p class="para" id="fs-id2491698">In addition to disease and medicine, genomics can contribute to the development of novel enzymes that convert biomass to biofuel, which results in higher crop and fuel production, and lower cost to the consumer. This knowledge should allow better methods of control over the microbes that are used in the production of biofuels. Genomics could also improve the methods used to monitor the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and help clean up environmental contaminants.
