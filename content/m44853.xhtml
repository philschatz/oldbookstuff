    >Humans are a part of the ecological landscape, and human health is one important part of human interaction with our physical and living environment. Lyme disease, for instance, serves as one modern-day example of the connection between our health and the natural world (<a

        data-effect="italics"
      >Ixodes scapularis</em
    >), which is the primary vector for this disease. However, not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans, and <em

      >I. scapularis </em
    >can have other hosts besides deer. In fact, it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host upon which the tick develops: a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks that live on deer. Knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host species is abundant would help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how Lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be reduced.</p
