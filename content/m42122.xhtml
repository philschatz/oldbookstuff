      >The motion of an American kestrel through the air can be described by the bird&#x2019;s displacement, speed, velocity, and acceleration. When it flies in a straight line without any change in direction, its motion is said to be one dimensional. (credit: Vince Maidens, Wikimedia Commons)</figcaption

    >Objects are in motion everywhere we look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. And even in inanimate objects, there is continuous motion in the vibrations of atoms and molecules. Questions about motion are interesting in and of themselves: <em

    > But an understanding of motion is also key to understanding other concepts in physics. An understanding of acceleration, for example, is crucial to the study of force. </p

      >study of motion without considering its causes</em
    >. The word &#x201C;kinematics&#x201D; comes from a Greek term meaning motion and is related to other English words such as &#x201C;cinema&#x201D; (movies) and &#x201C;kinesiology&#x201D; (the study of human motion). In one-dimensional kinematics and <a
