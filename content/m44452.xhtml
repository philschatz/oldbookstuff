Continuation of a signal in this manner is called <span class="term">signal transduction</span>. Signal transduction only occurs with cell-surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1511912">When a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that affect the receptor&#8217;s intracellular domain. Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins. In some cases, binding of the ligand causes <span class="term">dimerization</span> of the receptor, which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer. A <span class="term">dimer</span> is a chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join together. The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id2348611">Binding Initiates a Signaling Pathway</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id2572263">After the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptor&#8217;s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a <span class="term">signaling pathway</span> or a signaling cascade. In a signaling pathway, second messengers, enzymes, and activated proteins interact with specific proteins, which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell&#8217;s environment (<a href="/#fig-ch09_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch09_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). The events in the cascade occur in a series, much like a current flows in a river. Interactions that occur before a certain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are called downstream events.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-idp100312512" data-class="art-connection"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Art Connection</div><p class="para" id="fs-id2890297"><figure id="fig-ch09_02_01"><figcaption>The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of cell growth, wound healing, and tissue repair.

What effect would this have on downstream cellular events?</p> </div><p class="para" id="fs-id2890952">Signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can affect different downstream events, depending on the conditions within the cell. A single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints based on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in different cell types. This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types. Another complicating element is <span class="term">signal integration</span> of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell. This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1368373">The effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades. At the initiation of the signal, a single ligand binds to a single receptor.

The phosphate can be added to a nucleotide such as GMP to form GDP or GTP. Phosphates are also often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins, where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid (<a href="/#fig-ch09_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch09_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a <span class="term">kinase</span>. Various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues often activates enzymes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme or create a binding site that interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade. Phosphorylation may activate or inactivate enzymes, and the reversal of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the effect.</p><figure id="fig-ch09_02_02"><figcaption>In protein phosphorylation, a phosphate group (PO<sub class="sub">4</sub><sup class="sup">-3 </sup>) is added to residues of the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-id1796409" data-alt="Molecular structures of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine are shown.

The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca<sup class="sup">2+</sup>) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling purposes, Ca<sup class="sup">2+</sup> is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca<sup class="sup">2+</sup> that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca<sup class="sup">2+</sup>. The response to the increase in Ca<sup class="sup">2+</sup> varies, depending on the cell type involved. For example, in the &#946;-cells of the pancreas, Ca<sup class="sup">2+</sup> signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca<sup class="sup">2+</sup> leads to muscle contractions.</p><p class="para" id="fs-id1511305">Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is <span class="term">cyclic AMP (cAMP)</span>.

The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called <span class="term">cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase)</span>. A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different.

The chain of events that conveys the signal through the cell is called a signaling pathway or cascade. Signaling pathways are often very complex because of the interplay between different proteins. A major component of cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes known as kinases. Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in a protein, changing their shapes, and activating or inactivating the protein. Small molecules like nucleotides can also be phosphorylated. Second messengers are small, non-protein molecules that are used to transmit a signal within a cell.
