We know a great deal about our Milky Way galaxy and of the billions of other galaxies beyond its fringes.

Most remarkable when we view the universe on the large scale is that once again explanations of its character and evolution are tied to the very small scale. Particle physics and the questions being asked about the very small scales may also have their answers in the very large scales. </p> <figure id="import-auto-id1169738110906"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1169737939845" alt="The photo shows a lot of small bright spots of different shapes and sizes on a black background.

Minute atoms and molecules explain the chemistry of substances on a much larger scale. Decays of tiny nuclei explain the hot interior of the Earth.

In fact, the time in years is the same as the distance in light years. For example, the Andromeda galaxy is 2 million light years away, so that the light now reaching us left it 2 million years ago. If we could be there now, Andromeda would be different. Similarly, light from the most distant galaxy left it 14 billion years ago. We have an incredible view of the past when looking great distances. We can try to see if the universe was different then&#8212;if distant galaxies are more tightly packed or have younger-looking stars, for example, than closer galaxies, in which case there has been an evolution in time. But the problem is that the uncertainties in our data are great. Cosmology is almost typified by these large uncertainties, so that we must be especially cautious in drawing conclusions. One consequence is that there are more questions than answers, and so there are many competing theories. Another consequence is that any hard data produce a major result. Discoveries of some importance are being made on a regular basis, the hallmark of a field in its golden age. </p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169737895245">Perhaps the most important characteristic of the universe is that all galaxies except those in our local cluster seem to be moving away from us at speeds proportional to their distance from our galaxy. It looks as if a gigantic explosion, universally called the <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737895549">Big Bang</span>, threw matter out some billions of years ago. This amazing conclusion is based on the pioneering work of Edwin Hubble (1889&#8211;1953), the American astronomer. In the 1920s, Hubble first demonstrated conclusively that other galaxies, many previously called nebulae or clouds of stars, were outside our own. He then found that all but the closest galaxies have a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that is proportional to their distance. The explanation is that there is a <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737754225">cosmological red shift</span> due to the expansion of space itself. The photon wavelength is stretched in transit from the source to the observer. Double the distance, and the red shift is doubled.

All observers see themselves as stationary; the other objects in space appear to be moving away from them.

It will look as if the fireball has cooled in the billions of years since the Big Bang. Gamow and collaborators predicted in the late 1940s that there should be blackbody radiation from the explosion filling space with a characteristic temperature of about 7 K. Such blackbody radiation would have its peak intensity in the microwave part of the spectrum. (See <a href="#fs-id1172427649801" data-target-id="fs-id1172427649801" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>.)

The star is 4 light years above the Earth-Sun plane. When the Earth is to the far left of the Sun, the angle between the line segment from the Earth to the Sun and the line segment from the Earth to the star is called theta one. When the Earth is in the diametrically opposite position (that is, the far right position) the angle between the same two lines is labeled theta two.

The angle of line of sight to the star is measured at intervals six months apart, and the distance is calculated by using the known diameter of the Earth&#8217;s orbit. This can be done for stars up to about 500 ly away. </figcaption></figure></div></div> </div> </body>
