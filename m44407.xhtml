In architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them. For example, a skyscraper should be built with several elevator banks; a hospital should be built so that its emergency room is easily accessible.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1969914">Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology, and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells ( <a href="/#fig-ch04-03-01" data-target-id="fig-ch04-03-01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Unlike prokaryotic cells, <span class="term">eukaryotic cells</span> have: 1) a membrane-bound nucleus; 2) numerous membrane-bound <span class="term">organelles</span> such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and others; and 3) several, rod-shaped chromosomes. Because a eukaryotic cell&#8217;s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane, it is often said to have a &#8220;true nucleus.&#8221; The word &#8220;organelle&#8221; means &#8220;little organ,&#8221; and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have specialized functions.</p><p class="para" id="fs-id1442604">At this point, it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells.

The fluid inside the cell is called the cytoplasm, and the cell is surrounded by a cell membrane. The nucleus takes up about one-half the width of the cell. Inside the nucleus is the chromatin, which is composed of DNA and associated proteins. A region of the chromatin is condensed into the nucleolus, a structure where ribosomes are synthesized. The nucleus is encased in a nuclear envelope, which is perforated by protein-lined pores that allow entry of material into the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded by the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, or ER. The smooth ER is the site of lipid synthesis. The rough ER has embedded ribosomes that give it a bumpy appearance. It synthesizes membrane and secretory proteins. In addition to the ER, many other organelles float inside the cytoplasm. These include the Golgi apparatus, which modifies proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER. The Golgi apparatus is made of layers of flat membranes. Mitochondria, which produce food for the cell, have an outer membrane and a highly folded inner membrane. Other, smaller organelles include peroxisomes that metabolize waste, lysosomes that digest food, and vacuoles. Ribosomes, responsible for protein synthesis, also float freely in the cytoplasm and are depicted as small dots. The last cellular component shown is the cytoskeleton, which has four different types of components: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules, and centrosomes. Microfilaments are fibrous proteins that line the cell membrane and make up the cellular cortex. Intermediate filaments are fibrous proteins that hold organelles in place. Microtubules form the mitotic spindle and maintain cell shape. Centrosomes are made of two tubular structures at right angles to one another. They form the microtubule-organizing center."> <img src="Figure_04_03_01a.png" data-mime-type="image/png" width="325"/> </span> </figure> <figure xmlns="" id="fs-id1322851"> <span class="media" id="fig-ch04-03-01b" alt="Part b: This illustration depicts a typical eukaryotic plant cell.

Other structures that the plant cell has in common with the animal cell include rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and ribosomes. The fluid inside the plant cell is called the cytoplasm, just as it is in an animal cell. The plant cell has three of the four cytoskeletal components found in animal cells: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. Plant cells do not have centrosomes. Plant cells have four structures not found in animals cells: chloroplasts, plastids, a central vacuole, and a cell wall. Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis; they have an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and stack of membranes inside the inner membrane. The central vacuole is a very large, fluid-filled structure that maintains pressure against the cell wall. Plastids store pigments.

A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group. The plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules, ions, water, and oxygen into and out of the cell.

Such cells are typically found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This is an excellent example of form following function. People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.</p> <figure id="fig-ch04-03-03" class=" "><span class="media" id="fig-ch04-03-03a" alt="The left part of this figure is a transmission electron micrograph of microvilli, which appear as long, slender stalks extending from the plasma membrane.

Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes from the proteins within it. However, proteins are not the only organic molecules found in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are found there, too. Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements are also dissolved in the cytoplasm.

You may remember that in prokaryotes, DNA is organized into a single circular chromosome. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every eukaryotic species has a specific number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its body&#8217;s cells. For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, while in fruit flies, it is eight. Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, proteins are attached to chromosomes, and they resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of threads.

We also know that bacteria have DNA and ribosomes, just as mitochondria and chloroplasts do. Scientists believe that host cells and bacteria formed an endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells ingested both aerobic and autotrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) but did not destroy them. Through many millions of years of evolution, these ingested bacteria became more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the autotrophic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.</p> </div></div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1968242">The Central Vacuole</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1293830">Previously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. If you look at <a href="/#fig-ch04-03-01" data-target-id="fig-ch04-03-01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" effect="bold">b</strong>, you will see that plant cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell. The <span class="term">central vacuole</span> plays a key role in regulating the cell&#8217;s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts? That&#8217;s because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and cytoplasm. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. This loss of support to the cell walls of plant cells results in the wilted appearance of the plant.</p><p class="para" id="fs-id1614743">The central vacuole also supports the expansion of the cell. When the central vacuole holds more water, the cell gets larger without having to invest a lot of energy in synthesizing new cytoplasm.</p> </div> </div> <div class="summary section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1758435">Section Summary</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1968090">Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a membrane), and has other membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions. The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleus&#8217;s nucleolus is the site of ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are either found in the cytoplasm or attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. They perform protein synthesis. Mitochondria participate in cellular respiration; they are responsible for the majority of ATP produced in the cell. Peroxisomes hydrolyze fatty acids, amino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles and vacuoles are storage and transport compartments. In plant cells, vacuoles also help break down macromolecules.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1783043">Animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes. The centrosome has two bodies perpendicular to each other, the centrioles, and has an unknown purpose in cell division. Lysosomes are the digestive organelles of animal cells.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1912984">Plant cells and plant-like cells each have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central vacuole. The plant cell wall, whose primary component is cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. The central vacuole can expand without having to produce more cytoplasm.</p> </div> <div class="art-exercise section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id2008668">Art Connections</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2197811"><div class="problem" id="fs-id2592346"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1462703"> <a href="/#fig-ch04-03-01" data-target-id="fig-ch04-03-01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> If the nucleolus were not able to carry out its function, what other cellular organelles would be affected?</p> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2027443"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1721291"> <a href="/#fig-ch04-03-01" data-target-id="fig-ch04-03-01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> Free ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum (which contains ribosomes) would not be able to form.</p> </div> </div></div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id2056070">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1798051"><div class="problem" id="fs-id1852978"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1744199">Which of the following is surrounded by two phospholipid bilayers?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1457492" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">the ribosomes</li> <li class="item">the vesicles</li> <li class="item">the cytoplasm</li> <li class="item">the nucleoplasm</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1969790"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1609028">D</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2004118"><div class="problem" id="fs-id1848502"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1967366">Peroxisomes got their name because hydrogen peroxide is:</p><ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1286775" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">used in their detoxification reactions</li> <li class="item">produced during their oxidation reactions</li> <li class="item">incorporated into their membranes</li> <li class="item">a cofactor for the organelles&#8217; enzymes </li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1449590"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1326150">B</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1429843"><div class="problem" id="fs-id1227675"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1863643">In plant cells, the function of the lysosomes is carried out by __________.</p><ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1664445" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">vacuoles</li> <li class="item">peroxisomes</li> <li class="item">ribosomes</li> <li class="item">nuclei</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1353746"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1327092">A</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1624048"><div class="problem" id="fs-id1339679"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1357418">Which of the following is found both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1322698" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">nucleus</li> <li class="item">mitochondrion</li> <li class="item">vacuole</li> <li class="item">ribosomes</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1527839"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1287092">D</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="free-response section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1417451">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1419640"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1981696"><p class="para" id="fs-id1286865">You already know that ribosomes are abundant in red blood cells.
