This would be like having only certain speeds at which a car can travel because its kinetic energy can have only certain values. We also find that some forms of energy transfer take place with discrete lumps of energy. While most of us are familiar with the quantization of matter into lumps called atoms, molecules, and the like, we are less aware that energy, too, can be quantized. Some of the earliest clues about the necessity of quantum mechanics over classical physics came from the quantization of energy.</p><figure id="import-auto-id1458382"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1919373" alt="The blackbody radiation graph of E M radiation intensity versus wavelengths is shown, with the visible band represented as vertical colored strip marked on x axis. Wavelength is along x axis and E M radiation intensity is along y axis. The variation of E M radiation intensity is shown by three curves that start at origin, rise up to their highest point and then drop toward the x axis smoothly, and finally extend parallel to the x axis. There are three curves for three different temperatures, and each has a different peak for radiation intensity. As the temperature decreases, the peak of the black body radiation curves moves to a lower radiation intensity and longer wavelength."> <img src="Figure 30_01_01a.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="250"/> </span> <figcaption>Graphs of blackbody radiation (from an ideal radiator) at three different radiator temperatures.

Let us begin by considering the emission and absorption of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The EM spectrum radiated by a hot solid is linked directly to the solid&#8217;s temperature. (See <a href="#import-auto-id1458382" data-target-id="import-auto-id1458382" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>.) An ideal radiator is one that has an emissivity of 1 at all wavelengths and, thus, is jet black.

All of this seems quite continuous, but it was the curve of the spectrum of intensity versus wavelength that gave a clue that the energies of the atoms in the solid are quantized. In fact, providing a theoretical explanation for the experimentally measured shape of the spectrum was a mystery at the turn of the century. When this &#8220;ultraviolet catastrophe&#8221; was eventually solved, the answers led to new technologies such as computers and the sophisticated imaging techniques described in earlier chapters. Once again, physics as an enabling science changed the way we live.</p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2907455">The German physicist Max Planck (1858&#8211;1947) used the idea that atoms and molecules in a body act like oscillators to absorb and emit radiation.

This is like a pendulum that has a characteristic oscillation frequency but can swing with only certain amplitudes. Quantization of energy also resembles a standing wave on a string that allows only particular harmonics described by integers. It is also similar to going up and down a hill using discrete stair steps rather than being able to move up and down a continuous slope. Your potential energy takes on discrete values as you move from step to step. </p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1451886">Using the quantization of oscillators, Planck was able to correctly describe the experimentally known shape of the blackbody spectrum. This was the first indication that energy is sometimes quantized on a small scale and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Although Planck&#8217;s theory comes from observations of a macroscopic object, its analysis is based on atoms and molecules. It was such a revolutionary departure from classical physics that Planck himself was reluctant to accept his own idea that energy states are not continuous. The general acceptance of Planck&#8217;s energy quantization was greatly enhanced by Einstein&#8217;s explanation of the photoelectric effect (discussed in the next section), which took energy quantization a step further. Planck was fully involved in the development of both early quantum mechanics and relativity. He quickly embraced Einstein&#8217;s special relativity, published in 1905, and in 1906 Planck was the first to suggest the correct formula for relativistic momentum, <math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>&#947;mu</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{p= ital "&#947;mu"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p> <figure id="import-auto-id1532199"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1492127" alt="A photo of German physicist Max Plank is shown."> <img src="Figure 30_01_02a.jpg" data-mime-type="image/png" width="300"/> </span> <figcaption>The German physicist Max Planck had a major influence on the early development of quantum mechanics, being the first to recognize that energy is sometimes quantized.

This 0.4 eV of energy is significant compared with typical atomic energies, which are on the order of an electron volt, or thermal energies, which are typically fractions of an electron volt. But on a macroscopic or classical scale, energies are typically on the order of joules. Even if macroscopic energies are quantized, the quantum steps are too small to be noticed. This is an example of the correspondence principle. For a large object, quantum mechanics produces results indistinguishable from those of classical physics.</p></div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1273466">Atomic Spectra</h1> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1796879">Now let us turn our attention to the <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">emission and absorption of EM radiation by gases</em>.

Studies of emissions of hot gases began more than two centuries ago, and it was soon recognized that these emission spectra contained huge amounts of information.
