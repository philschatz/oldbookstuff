As you might expect, if cells are to work together, they must communicate with each other, just as you need to communicate with others if you work on a group project. Let&#8217;s take a look at how cells communicate with each other.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1358496">Extracellular Matrix of Animal Cells</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1322851">Most animal cells release materials into the extracellular space. The primary components of these materials are proteins, and the most abundant protein is collagen. Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate-containing protein molecules called proteoglycans. Collectively, these materials are called the <span class="term">extracellular matrix</span> (<a href="/#fig-ch04-06-01" data-target-id="fig-ch04-06-01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other. How can this happen?</p> <figure id="fig-ch04-06-01"><figcaption>The extracellular matrix consists of a network of proteins and carbohydrates.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-id1488943" data-alt="This illustration shows the plasma membrane. Embedded in the plasma membrane are integral membrane proteins called integrins. On the exterior of the cell is a vast network of collagen fibers. The fibers are attached to the integrins via a protein called fibronectin. Proteoglycan complexes also extend from the plasma membrane to the extracellular matrix. A close-up view shows that each proteoglycan complex is composed of a polysaccharide core. Proteins branch from this core, and carbohydrates branch from the proteins. The inside of the cytoplasmic membrane is lined with microfilaments of the cytoskeleton."> <img src="Figure_04_06_01.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" alt="This illustration shows the plasma membrane.

When a molecule within the matrix binds to the receptor, it changes the molecular structure of the receptor. The receptor, in turn, changes the conformation of the microfilaments positioned just inside the plasma membrane. These conformational changes induce chemical signals inside the cell that reach the nucleus and turn &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off&#8221; the transcription of specific sections of DNA, which affects the production of associated proteins, thus changing the activities within the cell.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1671786">Blood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication. When the cells lining a blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with another factor in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel, stimulates the adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and initiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1741467">Intercellular Junctions</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1209067">Cells can also communicate with each other via direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions. There are some differences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this. Plasmodesmata are junctions between plant cells, whereas animal cell contacts include tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1227229">Plasmodesmata</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1753183">In general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because they are separated by the cell wall that surrounds each cell (<a href="/m44407#fig-ch04-03-01" data-target-id="fig-ch04-03-01" data-document="m44407" class="autogenerated">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" data-effect="bold">b</strong>). How then, can a plant transfer water and other soil nutrients from its roots, through its stems, and to its leaves? Such transport uses the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) primarily. There also exist structural modifications called <span class="term">plasmodesmata</span> (singular = plasmodesma), numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connect their cytoplasm, and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell, and thus throughout the plant (<a href="/#fig-ch04-06-02" data-target-id="fig-ch04-06-02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch04-06-02"><figcaption>A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells.

Short proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes. The cadherins join two adjacent cells together and maintain the cells in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and muscles.</p> <figure id="fig-ch04-06-04"><figcaption>A desmosome forms a very strong spot weld between cells.

When the pores (&#8220;doughnut holes&#8221;) of connexons in adjacent animal cells align, a channel between the two cells forms. Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle: The electrical signal for the muscle to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in tandem.</p><div class="note" id="fs-id1870043" data-class="interactive"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-id1450230" data-alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="microscopy_lab.png" data-mime-type="image/png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="130"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-id1961754">To conduct a virtual microscopy lab and review the parts of a cell, work through the steps of this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/microscopy_lab" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/microscopy_lab">interactive assignment</a>.</p> </div></div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1886153">Section Summary</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1429783">Animal cells communicate via their extracellular matrices and are connected to each other via tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions.
