The evolution of amniotic membranes meant that the embryos of amniotes were provided with their own aquatic environment, which led to less dependence on water for development and thus allowed the amniotes to branch out into drier environments. This was a significant development that distinguished them from amphibians, which were restricted to moist environments due their shell-less eggs. Although the shells of various amniotic species vary significantly, they all allow retention of water. The shells of bird eggs are composed of calcium carbonate and are hard, but fragile. The shells of reptile eggs are leathery and require a moist environment. Most mammals do not lay eggs (except for monotremes). Instead, the embryo grows within the mother&#8217;s body; however, even with this internal gestation, amniotic membranes are still present.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp230325376">Characteristics of Amniotes</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp97601536">The amniotic egg is the key characteristic of amniotes. In amniotes that lay eggs, the shell of the egg provides protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The albumin, or egg white, provides the embryo with water and protein, whereas the fattier egg yolk is the energy supply for the embryo, as is the case with the eggs of many other animals, such as amphibians. However, the eggs of amniotes contain three additional extra-embryonic membranes: the chorion, amnion, and allantois (<a href="/#fig-ch29_04_01" data-target-id="fig-ch29_04_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Extra-embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo. While the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself, the <span class="term">chorion</span> surrounds the embryo and yolk sac. The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg&#8217;s external environment. The <span class="term">amnion</span> protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration. The <span class="term">allantois</span> stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration. In mammals, membranes that are homologous to the extra-embryonic membranes in eggs are present in the placenta.</p> <div class="art-connection" id="fs-idp235496192"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Art Connection</div> <figure id="fig-ch29_04_01" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp83365680" alt="The illustration shows an egg with the shell, embryo, yolk, yolk sac, and the extra-embryonic membranes"> <img src="Figure_29_04_01.png" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="280"/> </span> <figcaption>The key features of an amniotic egg are shown.</figcaption></figure> <p class="para" id="fs-idp56373120">Which of the following statements about the parts of an egg are false?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp143445408" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">The allantois stores nitrogenous waste and facilitates respiration.</li> <li class="item">The chorion facilitates gas exchange.</li> <li class="item">The yolk provides food for the growing embryo.</li> <li class="item">The amniotic cavity is filled with albumen.</li> </ol> <!--<para><link target-id="fig-ch29_04_01" document=""/>D</para>--> </div><p class="para" id="fs-idp181595248">Additional derived characteristics of amniotes include waterproof skin, due to the presence of lipids, and costal (rib) ventilation of the lungs.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp190324400">Evolution of Amniotes</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm27441792">The first amniotes evolved from amphibian ancestors approximately 340 million years ago during the Carboniferous period.

Limbless reptiles&#8212;snakes and other squamates&#8212;have vestigial limbs and, like caecilians, are classified as tetrapods because they are descended from four-limbed ancestors. Reptiles lay eggs enclosed in shells on land. Even aquatic reptiles return to the land to lay eggs. They usually reproduce sexually with internal fertilization. Some species display ovoviviparity, with the eggs remaining in the mother&#8217;s body until they are ready to hatch. Other species are viviparous, with the offspring born alive.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp121112000">One of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of their scaly skin, containing the protein keratin and waxy lipids, which reduced water loss from the skin. This occlusive skin means that reptiles cannot use their skin for respiration, like amphibians, and thus all breathe with lungs.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp157323360">Reptiles are ectotherms, animals whose main source of body heat comes from the environment. This is in contrast to endotherms, which use heat produced by metabolism to regulate body temperature. In addition to being ectothermic, reptiles are categorized as poikilotherms, or animals whose body temperatures vary rather than remain stable. Reptiles have behavioral adaptations to help regulate body temperature, such as basking in sunny places to warm up and finding shady spots or going underground to cool down. The advantage of ectothermy is that metabolic energy from food is not required to heat the body; therefore, reptiles can survive on about 10 percent of the calories required by a similarly sized endotherm. In cold weather, some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate. <span class="term">Brumation</span> is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating, but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves. Rather, their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures, and the animal is very sluggish.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp88244944">Evolution of Reptiles</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp150265696">Reptiles originated approximately 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. One of the oldest known amniotes is <span class="term">Casineria</span>, which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics. One of the earliest undisputed reptiles was <span class="term">Hylonomus</span>. Soon after the first amniotes appeared, they diverged into three groups&#8212;synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids&#8212;during the Permian period. The Permian period also saw a second major divergence of diapsid reptiles into archosaurs (predecessors of crocodilians and dinosaurs) and lepidosaurs (predecessors of snakes and lizards). These groups remained inconspicuous until the Triassic period, when the archosaurs became the dominant terrestrial group due to the extinction of large-bodied anapsids and synapsids during the Permian-Triassic extinction. About 250 million years ago, archosaurs radiated into the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs.</p><p class="para" id="fs-idp68272816">Although they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs, the pterosaurs were distinct from true dinosaurs (<a href="/#fig-ch29_04_04" data-target-id="fig-ch29_04_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Pterosaurs had a number of adaptations that allowed for flight, including hollow bones (birds also exhibit hollow bones, a case of convergent evolution). Their wings were formed by membranes of skin that attached to the long, fourth finger of each arm and extended along the body to the legs.</p> <figure id="fig-ch29_04_04" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm36737296" alt="The illustration shows pterosaurs, which resemble large modern birds with long necks, long beaks, and bat-like wings."> <img src="Figure_29_04_04.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="310"/> </span> <figcaption>Pterosaurs, which existed from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous period (210 to 65.5 million years ago), possessed wings but are not believed to have been capable of powered flight.

It is not known whether dinosaurs were endotherms or ectotherms. However, given that modern birds are endothermic, the dinosaurs that served as ancestors to birds likely were endothermic as well.
