The motion of stars in galaxies and the motion of galaxies in clusters imply that there is about 10 times as much mass as in the luminous objects we can see. The indirectly observed non-luminous matter is called <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737003171">dark matter</span>. Why is dark matter a problem? For one thing, we do not know what it is. It may well be 90% of all matter in the universe, yet there is a possibility that it is of a completely unknown form&#8212;a stunning discovery if verified. Dark matter has implications for particle physics. It may be possible that neutrinos actually have small masses or that there are completely unknown types of particles. Dark matter also has implications for cosmology, since there may be enough dark matter to stop the expansion of the universe. That is another problem related to dark matter&#8212;we do not know how much there is. We keep finding evidence for more matter in the universe, and we have an idea of how much it would take to eventually stop the expansion of the universe, but whether there is enough is still unknown.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1169737814466">Evidence</h1> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169738082971">The first clues that there is more matter than meets the eye came from the Swiss-born American astronomer Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s; some initial work was also done by the American astronomer Vera Rubin. Zwicky measured the velocities of stars orbiting the galaxy, using the relativistic Doppler shift of their spectra (see <a href="#import-auto-id1169738239706" data-target-id="import-auto-id1169738239706" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>(a)). He found that velocity varied with distance from the center of the galaxy, as graphed in <a href="#import-auto-id1169738239706" data-target-id="import-auto-id1169738239706" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>(b). If the mass of the galaxy was concentrated in its center, as are its luminous stars, the velocities should decrease as the square root of the distance from the center. Instead, the velocity curve is almost flat, implying that there is a tremendous amount of matter in the galactic halo. Although not immediately recognized for its significance, such measurements have now been made for many galaxies, with similar results. Further, studies of galactic clusters have also indicated that galaxies have a mass distribution greater than that obtained from their brightness (proportional to the number of stars), which also extends into large halos surrounding the luminous parts of galaxies. Observations of other EM wavelengths, such as radio waves and X rays, have similarly confirmed the existence of dark matter. Take, for example, X rays in the relatively dark space between galaxies, which indicates the presence of previously unobserved hot, ionized gas (see <a href="#import-auto-id1169738239706" data-target-id="import-auto-id1169738239706" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>(c)).</p></div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1169738037307">Theoretical Yearnings for Closure</h1> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169737769809">Is the universe open or closed?

Finally, the most recent measurements of the CMBR have implications for the cosmological constant, so it is not simply a device concocted for a single purpose.</p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169737768989">After the recent experimental discovery of the cosmological constant, most researchers feel that the universe should be just barely open. Since matter can be thought to curve the space around it, we call an open universe <span class="term">negatively curved</span>. This means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction. A universe that is closed is called <span class="term">positively curved</span>. This means that if you travel far enough in any direction, you will return to your starting point, analogous to circumnavigating the Earth. In between these two is a <span class="term">flat (zero curvature) universe</span>. The recent discovery of the cosmological constant has shown the universe is very close to flat, and will expand forever. Why do theorists feel the universe is flat? Flatness is a part of the inflationary scenario that helps explain the flatness of the microwave background. In fact, since general relativity implies that matter creates the space in which it exists, there is a special symmetry to a flat universe.</p><figure id="import-auto-id1169738239706"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1169738106751" alt="Figure a shows an eye looking toward a rotating spiral galaxy.

As always, we seek to explain new observations in terms of known principles. However, as more discoveries are made, it is becoming more and more difficult to explain dark matter as a known type of matter.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169738128044">One of the possibilities for normal matter is being explored using the Hubble Space Telescope and employing the lensing effect of gravity on light (see <a href="#import-auto-id1169737718755" data-target-id="import-auto-id1169737718755" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Stars glow because of nuclear fusion in them, but planets are visible primarily by reflected light. Jupiter, for example, is too small to ignite fusion in its core and become a star, but we can see sunlight reflected from it, since we are relatively close. If Jupiter orbited another star, we would not be able to see it directly. The question is open as to how many planets or other bodies smaller than about 1/1000 the mass of the Sun are there. If such bodies pass between us and a star, they will not block the star&#8217;s light, being too small, but they will form a gravitational lens, as discussed in <a href="/m42689" data-document="m42689">General Relativity and Quantum Gravity</a>.</p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169736588837">In a process called <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737801974">microlensing</span>, light from the star is focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner.

Such microlensing objects are thus called <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169736619350">massive compact halo objects</span>, or <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737756089">MACHOs</span>.

Others being actively pursued are red dwarfs, which are small dim stars, but too few have been seen so far, even with the Hubble Telescope, to be of significance. Old remnants of stars called white dwarfs are also under consideration, since they contain about a solar mass, but are small as the Earth and may dim to the point that we ordinarily do not observe them. While white dwarfs are known, old dim ones are not. Yet another possibility is the existence of large numbers of smaller than stellar mass black holes left from the Big Bang&#8212;here evidence is entirely absent.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169738164259">There is a very real possibility that dark matter is composed of the known neutrinos, which may have small, but finite, masses. As discussed earlier, neutrinos are thought to be massless, but we only have upper limits on their masses, rather than knowing they are exactly zero. So far, these upper limits come from difficult measurements of total energy emitted in the decays and reactions in which neutrinos are involved.

It should also change neutrino flavor&#8212;that is, any type of neutrino could change spontaneously into any other, a process called <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1169737972747">neutrino oscillations</span>. However, this can occur only if neutrinos have a mass. Why? Crudely, because if neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of light and time will not pass for them, so that they cannot change without an interaction. In 1999, results began to be published containing convincing evidence that neutrino oscillations do occur. Using the Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan, the oscillations have been observed and are being verified and further explored at present at the same facility and others.</p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1169737967704">Neutrino oscillations may also explain the low number of observed solar neutrinos.

The proposal is radical in the sense that it invokes entirely new forms of matter, in fact <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">two</em> entirely new forms, in order to explain dark matter and other phenomena. WIMPs have the extra burden of automatically being very difficult to observe directly. This is somewhat analogous to quark confinement, which guarantees that quarks are there, but they can never be seen directly. One of the primary goals of the LHC at CERN, however, is to produce and detect WIMPs. At any rate, before WIMPs are accepted as the best explanation, all other possibilities utilizing known phenomena will have to be shown inferior. Should that occur, we will be in the unanticipated position of admitting that, to date, all we know is only 10% of what exists.
