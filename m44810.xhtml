Three excretory systems evolved in organisms before complex kidneys: vacuoles, flame cells, and Malpighian tubules.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp224949888">Contractile Vacuoles in Microorganisms</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp111471536">The most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell. In other words, a cell is the simplest functional unit of a life. Bacteria are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes in place; however, prokaryotes such as bacteria do not contain membrane-bound vacuoles. The cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, and fungi are bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment. Some cells, including some leucocytes in humans, are able to engulf food by endocytosis&#8212;the formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane within the cells. The same vesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment. In some unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as the amoeba, shown in <a href="/#fig-ch41_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch41_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, cellular wastes and excess water are excreted by exocytosis, when the contractile vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and expel wastes into the environment. Contractile vacuoles (CV) should not be confused with vacuoles, which store food or water.</p> <figure id="fig-ch41_02_01" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp87139600" alt="In this illustration, a cell extends a pseudopod to consume a food particle. The consumed particle is encapsulated in a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a lysosome, and proteins inside the lysosome digest the food particle.

Planaria are flatworms that live in fresh water. Their excretory system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system. The cells in the tubules are called <span class="term">flame cells</span> (or <span class="term">protonephridia</span>) because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch41_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch41_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" effect="bold">a</strong>. The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration. Any valuable metabolites are recovered by reabsorption. Flame cells are found in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria. They also maintain the organism&#8217;s osmotic balance.</p> <figure id="fig-ch41_02_02" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp129288720" alt="Illustration A shows a flame cell, which is bulb-shaped with cilia projecting from one end. The cilia form a point, like the tip of a paintbrush, inside as wide opening at the end of a tube cell. The tube cell narrows into a tubule, then widens into a body where the nucleus is located. The tubule continues past the cell body. Illustration B shows a cross section of an earthworm, which is segmented with walls separating each segment. The trumpet-like opening of a nephridium sticks out of the wall. Cilia surround the opening. Beyond the wall, the nephridium forms a tube that winds down to the ventral surface, where it connects with an opening to the exterior. Just above the opening the tube widens into a bladder."> <img src="Figure_41_02_02.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="520"/> </span> <figcaption>In the excretory system of the (a) planaria, cilia of flame cells propel waste through a tubule formed by a tube cell. Tubules are connected into branched structures that lead to pores located all along the sides of the body. The filtrate is secreted through these pores. In (b) annelids such as earthworms, nephridia filter fluid from the coelom, or body cavity. Beating cilia at the opening of the nephridium draw water from the coelom into a tubule. As the filtrate passes down the tubules, nutrients and other solutes are reabsorbed by capillaries. Filtered fluid containing nitrogenous and other wastes is stored in a bladder and then secreted through a pore in the side of the body.</figcaption></figure><p class="para" id="fs-idp230869040">Earthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures called <span class="term">nephridia</span>, illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch41_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch41_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" effect="bold">b</strong>.

They are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. Malpighian tubules are convoluted, which increases their surface area, and they are lined with <span class="term">microvilli</span> for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance. Malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum. Body fluids are not filtered as in the case of nephridia; urine is produced by tubular secretion mechanisms by the cells lining the Malpighian tubules that are bathed in hemolymph (a mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as most mollusks). Metabolic wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules. There are exchange pumps lining the tubules, which actively transport H<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions into the cell and K<sup class="sup">+</sup> or Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions out; water passively follows to form urine. The secretion of ions alters the osmotic pressure which draws water, electrolytes, and nitrogenous waste (uric acid) into the tubules. Water and electrolytes are reabsorbed when these organisms are faced with low-water environments, and uric acid is excreted as a thick paste or powder. Not dissolving wastes in water helps these organisms to conserve water; this is especially important for life in dry environments.</p> <figure id="fig-ch41_02_03" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp183407376" alt="Illustration shows the digestive tract of a bee.

The urine passes through the intestine, and into the rectum. There, nutrients diffuse back into the hemolymph. Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> and/or K<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions are pumped into the hemolymph, and water follows.
