The products of the light-dependent reactions, ATP and NADPH, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the light-independent reactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive for hundreds of millions of years. The carbohydrate molecules made will have a backbone of carbon atoms. Where does the carbon come from? It comes from carbon dioxide, the gas that is a waste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm160767200">The Calvin Cycle</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm22256">In plants, carbon dioxide (CO<sub class="sub">2</sub>) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances through intercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells. Once in the mesophyll cells, CO<sub class="sub">2</sub> diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast&#8212;the site of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions actually have several names associated with them. Another term, the <span class="term">Calvin cycle</span>, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions function as a cycle. Others call it the Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery. The most outdated name is dark reactions, because light is not directly required (<a href="/#fig-ch08_03_01" data-target-id="fig-ch08_03_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). However, the term dark reaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light, which is why most scientists and instructors no longer use it.</p> <figure id="fig-ch08_03_01"><figcaption>Light reactions harness energy from the sun to produce chemical bonds, ATP, and NADPH.

But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three turns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO<sub class="sub">2</sub> to be fixed.

This modern oxygenic photosynthesis is used by many organisms&#8212;from giant tropical leaves in the rainforest to tiny cyanobacterial cells&#8212;and the process and components of this photosynthesis remain largely the same. Photosystems absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy into the chemical energy of ATP and NADH. The subsequent light-independent reactions then assemble carbohydrate molecules with this energy.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm140187264">Photosynthesis in desert plants has evolved adaptations that conserve water. In the harsh dry heat, every drop of water must be used to survive. Because stomata must open to allow for the uptake of CO<sub class="sub">2</sub>, water escapes from the leaf during active photosynthesis. Desert plants have evolved processes to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions. A more efficient use of CO<sub class="sub">2</sub> allows plants to adapt to living with less water. Some plants such as cacti (<a href="/#fig-ch08_03_03" data-target-id="fig-ch08_03_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>) can prepare materials for photosynthesis during the night by a temporary carbon fixation/storage process, because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler temperatures. In addition, cacti have evolved the ability to carry out low levels of photosynthesis without opening stomata at all, an extreme mechanism to face extremely dry periods.</p> </div><figure id="fig-ch08_03_03"><figcaption>The harsh conditions of the desert have led plants like these cacti to evolve variations of the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.

But if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially when it has been shown that the gas organisms release as a &#8220;waste product&#8221; (CO<sub class="sub">2</sub>) acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in photosynthesis? Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. In addition, an organism can either make its own food or eat another organism&#8212;either way, the food still needs to be broken down. Finally, in the process of breaking down food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce &#8220;waste&#8221; in the form of CO<sub class="sub">2</sub> gas.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm154538240">In nature, there is no such thing as waste.

Both are byproducts of reactions and move on to other reactions. Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular respiration releases energy by using oxygen to take metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Both processes use electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive the reactions, because breaking down a substance requires energy. These two powerhouse processes, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining energy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun.</p> <figure id="fig-ch08_03_04"><figcaption>Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
