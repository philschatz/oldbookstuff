Phylogenetic relationships provide information on shared ancestry but not necessarily on how organisms are similar or different.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm3522544">Phylogenetic Trees</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp113710944">Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms. A <span class="term">phylogenetic tree</span> is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, a &#8220;tree of life&#8221; can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms (<a href="/#fig-ch20_01_01" data-target-id="fig-ch20_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm25303200">Unlike a taxonomic classification diagram, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history. Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. Scientists call such trees <span class="term">rooted</span>, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains&#8212; Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya&#8212;diverge from a single point and branch off. The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees don&#8217;t show a common ancestor but do show relationships among species.</p> <figure id="fig-ch20_01_01"><figcaption>Both of these phylogenetic trees shows the relationship of the three domains of life&#8212;Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya&#8212;but the (a) rooted tree attempts to identify when various species diverged from a common ancestor while the (b) unrooted tree does not.

The pathway can be traced from the origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a single species and tracing backward to any point, the adjoining organisms can be viewed to understand the relation among that species and others. In addition, the tree can be used to study entire groups of organisms.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp51522928">Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. For example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the evolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp20620384">Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the &#8220;tree of life.&#8221; Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called <span class="term">systematics</span>. Data may be collected from fossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by DNA analysis. By combining data from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp66539744">Limitations of Phylogenetic Trees</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp15260000">It may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike, and while this is often the case, it is not always true. If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings or after the evolution of a major new adaptation, it is possible for the two groups to appear more different than other groups that are not as closely related. For example, the phylogenetic tree in <a href="/#fig-ch20_01_03" data-target-id="fig-ch20_01_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs, whereas frogs do not; yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and rabbits.</p> <figure id="fig-ch20_01_03"><figcaption>This ladder-like phylogenetic tree of vertebrates is rooted by an organism that lacked a vertebral column.

In other words, the length of a branch does not typically mean more time passed, nor does a short branch mean less time passed&#8212; unless specified on the diagram. For example, in <a href="/#fig-ch20_01_03" data-target-id="fig-ch20_01_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, the tree does not indicate how much time passed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair. What the tree does show is the order in which things took place. Again using <a href="/#fig-ch20_01_03" data-target-id="fig-ch20_01_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, the tree shows that the oldest trait is the vertebral column, followed by hinged jaws, and so forth. Remember that any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and like a real tree, it does not grow in only one direction after a new branch develops. So, for the organisms in <a href="/#fig-ch20_01_03" data-target-id="fig-ch20_01_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, just because a vertebral column evolved does not mean that invertebrate evolution ceased, it only means that a new branch formed. Also, groups that are not closely related, but evolve under similar conditions, may appear more phenotypically similar to each other than to a close relative.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-idp21663728" data-class="interactive"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-idp95692752" data-alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="tree_of_life.png" data-mime-type="image/png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-idm44792448">Head to this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tree_of_life" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tree_of_life">website</a> to see interactive exercises that allow you to explore the evolutionary relationships among species.</p> </div></div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm96444544">The Levels of Classification</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp20465712"><span class="term">Taxonomy</span> (which literally means &#8220;arrangement law&#8221;) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings. Think about how a grocery store is organized. One large space is divided into departments, such as produce, dairy, and meats. Then each department further divides into aisles, then each aisle into categories and brands, and then finally a single product. This organization from larger to smaller, more specific categories is called a hierarchical system.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp56936704">The taxonomic classification system (also called the Linnaean system after its inventor, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician) uses a hierarchical model. Moving from the point of origin, the groups become more specific, until one branch ends as a single species. For example, after the common beginning of all life, scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within each domain is a second category called a <span class="term">kingdom</span>. After kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: <span class="term">phylum</span>, <span class="term">class</span>, <span class="term">order</span>, <span class="term">family</span>, <span class="term">genus</span>, and <span class="term">species</span> (<a href="/#fig-ch20_01_04" data-target-id="fig-ch20_01_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch20_01_04"><figcaption>The taxonomic classification system uses a hierarchical model to organize living organisms into increasingly specific categories.
