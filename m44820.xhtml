Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication. The innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly a billion years ago, as an essential response to infection. Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any pathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection independently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. For example, tears and mucus secretions contain microbicidal factors.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp87903728">Physical and Chemical Barriers</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp201017536">Before any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to potentially infectious pathogens. Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out) and by the skin&#8217;s acidity. In addition, beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens, preventing infection. Regions of the body that are not protected by skin (such as the eyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus with the pathogens out of the body. Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the stomach (which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and the process of urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp41306240">Despite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. Some pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers. When pathogens do enter the body, the innate immune system responds with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and proteins.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp93047808">Pathogen Recognition</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp203619200">An infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. All viruses infect cells and replicate within those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly, depending on the species. The innate immune system must respond accordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been infected. When a pathogen enters the body, cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific <span class="term">pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)</span> on the pathogen&#8217;s surface. PAMPs are carbohydrate, polypeptide, and nucleic acid &#8220;signatures&#8221; that are expressed by viruses, bacteria, and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells. The immune system has specific cells, described in <a href="/#fig-ch42_01_01" data-target-id="fig-ch42_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> and shown in <a href="/#fig-ch42_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch42_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, with receptors that recognize these PAMPs. A <span class="term">macrophage</span> is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens. Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary <span class="term">pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)</span>. PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment. A <span class="term">monocyte</span> is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue. Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a type of PRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules). TRLs are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, and appear to be one of the most ancient components of the immune system. TRLs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system.</p><figure id="fig-ch42_01_01" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp137705680" alt=" Table shows various types of white blood cells and describes their function. Mast cells, natural killer cells, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils are all filled with granules and have a horseshoe-shaped nucleus. Macrophages are irregular in shape, with a round nucleus. Dendrites have star-like projections and a small horseshoe shaped nucleus. Mast cells dilate blood vessels and induce inflammation through release of histamines and heparin. They also recruit macrophages and neutrophils, and are involved in wound healing and defense against pathogens, but can also be responsible for allergic reactions. They are found in connective tissue and mucous membranes. Macrophages are phagocytic cells that consume foreign pathogens and cancer cells. They stimulate response of other immune cells and migrate from blood vessels into tissues. Natural killer cells kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells. They circulate in blood and migrate into tissues. Dendritic cells present antigens on their surface, thereby triggering adaptive immunity. They are present in tissues in epithelial tissue, including skin, lung and tissues of the digestive tract. Migrate to lymph nodes upon activation. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells in response to inflammation. They are stored in spleen, move through blood vessels to infected tissues. Neutrophils are first responders at the site of infection or trauma, these abundant phagocytic cell representing 50-60% of all leukocytes. Release toxins that kill or inhibit bacteria and fungi and recruit other immune cells to the site of infection. They migrate from blood vessels into tissues. Basophils are responsible for defense against parasites. They release histamines that cause inflammation and may be responsible for allergic reactions. They circulate in blood and migrate to tissues. Eosinophils release toxins that kill bacteria and parasites but also causes tissue damage. They circulate in blood and migrate to tissues."> <img src="Figure_42_01_01.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="575"/> </span> <figcaption>The characteristics and location of cells involved in the innate immune system are described.

A <span class="term">cytokine</span> is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and function), proliferation (production), and gene expression to effect immune responses. At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them, the cell type that responds to them, and the changes they produce. One type cytokine, interferon, is illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch42_01_03" data-target-id="fig-ch42_01_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp41678736">One subclass of cytokines is the interleukin (IL), so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes (white blood cells). Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition to being released from cells after PAMP recognition, cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells to release cytokines, which results in a cytokine burst.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp46077088">A second class of early-acting cytokines is interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells. One of the functions of an <span class="term">interferon</span> is to inhibit viral replication. They also have other important functions, such as tumor surveillance. Interferons work by signaling neighboring uninfected cells to destroy RNA and reduce protein synthesis, signaling neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), and activating immune cells.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp208017376">In response to interferons, uninfected cells alter their gene expression, which increases the cells&#8217; resistance to infection. One effect of interferon-induced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis. Virally infected cells produce more viruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins. Thus, by reducing protein synthesis, a cell becomes resistant to viral infection.</p> <figure id="fig-ch42_01_03" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm34492304" alt="Illustration shows a virus-infected cell secreting interferon, which binds to receptors of neighboring cells. Interferon signals neighboring uninfected cells to destroy RNA and reduce protein synthesis, thus making it more difficult for virus to infect the cell. It signals neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis. It also activates nearby immune cells."> <img src="Figure_42_01_03.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="320"/> </span> <figcaption>Interferons are cytokines that are released by a cell infected with a virus. Response of neighboring cells to interferon helps stem the infection.</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp26175392">Phagocytosis and Inflammation</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm6157888">The first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory; that is, they encourage <span class="term">inflammation</span>, the localized redness, swelling, heat, and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection. The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen. Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis. A <span class="term">neutrophil</span> is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens. Neutrophils, shown in <a href="/#fig-ch42_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch42_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system. Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes, and they contain organelles, called lysosomes, that digest engulfed pathogens. An <span class="term">eosinophil</span> is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes (parasitic worms).</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp114173136">Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi. A <span class="term">mast cell</span> is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens. A <span class="term">basophil</span> is a leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch42_01_04" data-target-id="fig-ch42_01_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses. Eosinophils and basophils produce additional inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes. A hypersensitive immune response to harmless antigens, such as in pollen, often involves the release of histamine by basophils and mast cells.</p><figure id="fig-ch42_01_04" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp6090368" alt=" Illustration shows a capillary near the surface of skin that has a cut in it. Bacteria have penetrated the skin around the cut. In response, mass cells in the lower part of the skin tissue release histamines, and dendritic cells release cytokines. The histamines cause the capillary to become permeable. Neutrophils and monocytes exit the capillary into the damaged skin. Both the neutrophil and macrophage release cytokines and consumes bacteria by phagocytosis."> <img src="Figure_42_01_04.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="280"/> </span> <figcaption>In response to a cut, mast cells secrete histamines that cause nearby capillaries to dilate. Neutrophils and monocytes leave the capillaries. Monocytes mature into macrophages. Neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages release chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response. Neutrophils and macrophages also consume invading bacteria by phagocytosis.</figcaption></figure><p class="para" id="fs-idp319744">Cytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling sick, which include lethargy, muscle pain, and nausea. These effects may have evolved because the symptoms encourage the individual to rest and prevent them from spreading the infection to others. Cytokines also increase the core body temperature, causing a fever, which causes the liver to withhold iron from the blood. Without iron, certain pathogens, such as some bacteria, are unable to replicate; this is called nutritional immunity.</p> <div class="interactive" id="fs-idm28058352"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-idp12938736" alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="conidia.png" data-mime-type="image/png" width="120"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-idp101416624">Watch this 23-second stop-motion <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/conidia" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/conidia">video</a> showing a neutrophil that searches for and engulfs fungus spores during an elapsed time of about 79 minutes.</p> </div></div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp90768352">Natural Killer Cells</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm41977392"><span class="term">Lymphocytes</span> are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large, darkly staining nuclei; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm, as shown in <a href="/#fig-ch42_01_05" data-target-id="fig-ch42_01_05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. Infected cells are identified and destroyed by <span class="term">natural killer (NK) cells</span>, lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells (abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue). T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes. <span class="term">T cells</span> are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland, and <span class="term">B cells</span> are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow. NK cells identify intracellular infections, especially from viruses, by the altered expression of <span class="term">major histocompatibility class (MHC) I molecules</span> on the surface of infected cells. MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells, thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non-nucleated. The function of MHC I molecules is to display fragments of proteins from the infectious agents within the cell to T-cells; healthy cells will be ignored, while &#8220;non-self&#8221; or foreign proteins will be attacked by the immune system. MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens (&#8220;non-self proteins&#8221;) and on lymphocytes. <span class="term">MHC II molecules</span> interact with helper T-cells to trigger the appropriate immune response, which may include the inflammatory response.</p><figure id="fig-ch42_01_05" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp93386912" alt="Micrograph shows a round cell with a large nucleus."> <img src="Figure_42_01_05.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="255"/> </span> <figcaption>Lymphocytes, such as NK cells, are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope.</figcaption></figure><p class="para" id="fs-idm8942528">An infected cell (or a tumor cell) is usually incapable of synthesizing and displaying MHC I molecules appropriately. The metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and/or trafficking to the cell surface. The reduced MHC I on host cells varies from virus to virus and results from active inhibitors being produced by the viruses. This process can deplete host MHC I molecules on the cell surface, which NK cells detect as &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; or &#8220;abnormal&#8221; while searching for cellular MHC I molecules. Similarly, the dramatically altered gene expression of tumor cells leads to expression of extremely deformed or absent MHC I molecules that also signal &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; or &#8220;abnormal.&#8221;</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm27614592">NK cells are always active; an interaction with normal, intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing sequence, and the NK cell moves on. After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell, its cytoplasm secretes granules comprised of <span class="term">perforin</span>, a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell. Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse. A <span class="term">granzyme</span> is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind. NK cells are constantly patrolling the body and are an effective mechanism for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp45079936">Complement</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp28868064">An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins, called a <span class="term">complement system</span>, functions to destroy extracellular pathogens. Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms. The complement system is so named because it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system. Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies. Binding of complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence, with each successive protein being activated by cleavage and/or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein(s). After the first few complement proteins bind, a cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement proteins.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp108047920">Complement proteins perform several functions. The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and B cells, and enhance engulfment; this process is called <span class="term">opsonization</span>. Certain complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes. These structures destroy pathogens by causing their contents to leak, as illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch42_01_06" data-target-id="fig-ch42_01_06" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>.</p> <figure id="fig-ch42_01_06" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm4981344" alt="Illustration shows an invading pathogen with an antigen on its surface. In the classic pathway for complement activation, host antibodies bind the antigen, and C1 binds the antibody. The C1-antibody complex causes C2 and C4 each to split in two. Fragments from C2 and C4 each joins together to form an enzyme called C3 convertase. C3convertase splits C3 in two. One of the fragments from C3 joins C3 convertase to form C5 convertase. C5 convertase splits C5 in two. A fragment from C5 joins C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form a complex that makes a hole in the plasma membrane for the invading cell. The cell swells and bursts. In the alternative pathway, C3 convertase spontaneously splits C3 in two and the rest of the pathway proceeds the same as the classic pathway. Host cells are protected from complement by the presence of endogenous proteins."> <img src="Figure_42_01_06.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="550"/> </span> <figcaption>The classic pathway for the complement cascade involves the attachment of several initial complement proteins to an antibody-bound pathogen followed by rapid activation and binding of many more complement proteins and the creation of destructive pores in the microbial cell envelope and cell wall. The alternate pathway does not involve antibody activation. Rather, C3 convertase spontaneously breaks down C3. Endogenous regulatory proteins prevent the complement complex from binding to host cells. Pathogens lacking these regulatory proteins are lysed.
