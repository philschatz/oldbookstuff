Non-human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates is of particular interest to us as it allows us to understand the evolution of our own species.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp19098736">Characteristics of Primates</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp129544720">All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers. This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for <span class="term">brachiation</span>, or climbing and swinging through trees. These adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs, which are widely separated from fingers (except humans), which allow for gripping branches, 3) <span class="term">stereoscopic vision</span>, two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp93540064">Order Primates is divided into two groups: prosimians and anthropoids. <span class="term">Prosimians</span> include the bush babies of Africa, the lemurs of Madagascar, and the lorises, pottos, and tarsiers of Southeast Asia. <span class="term">Anthropoids</span> include monkeys, apes, and humans. In general, prosimians tend to be nocturnal (in contrast to diurnal anthropoids) and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm56446208">Evolution of Primates</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm10382048">The first primate-like mammals are referred to as proto-primates. They were roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size and appearance. The existing fossil evidence (mostly from North Africa) is very fragmented. These proto-primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available. The oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is <span class="term"><em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Plesiadapis</em></span> (although some researchers do not agree that <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Plesiadapis</em> was a proto-primate). Fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately 55 million years ago. Plesiadapiforms were proto-primates that had some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates. They were found in North America and Europe in the Cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the Eocene.</p><p class="para" id="fs-idp94790960">The first true primates were found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa in the Eocene Epoch. These early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs. Evolutionary changes continued in these early primates, with larger brains and eyes, and smaller muzzles being the trend. By the end of the Eocene Epoch, many of the early prosimian species went extinct due either to cooler temperatures or competition from the first monkeys.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm60205392">Anthropoid monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Oligocene Epoch. By 40 million years ago, evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the New World (South America) and the Old World (Africa and Asia). New World monkeys are also called <span class="term">Platyrrhini</span>&#8212;a reference to their broad noses (<a href="/#fig-ch29_07_01" data-target-id="fig-ch29_07_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Old World monkeys are called <span class="term">Catarrhini</span>&#8212;a reference to their narrow noses. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the origins of the New World monkeys. At the time the platyrrhines arose, the continents of South American and Africa had drifted apart. Therefore, it is thought that monkeys arose in the Old World and reached the New World either by drifting on log rafts or by crossing land bridges. Due to this reproductive isolation, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations over millions of years. The New World monkeys are all arboreal, whereas Old World monkeys include arboreal and ground-dwelling species.</p> <figure id="fig-ch29_07_01" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp75266800" alt="The photo shows a black monkey with its mouth open in a howl."> <img src="Figure_29_07_01.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="355"/> </span> <figcaption>The howler monkey is native to Central and South America.

Apes are generally larger than monkeys and they do not possess a tail. All apes are capable of moving through trees, although many species spend most their time on the ground. Apes are more intelligent than monkeys, and they have relatively larger brains proportionate to body size. The apes are divided into two groups.

Evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately 6 million years ago. Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans, although our species is the only surviving member. The term <span class="term">hominin</span> is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees. Hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our species&#8212;including <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Australopithecus</em>,<em class="emphasis" effect="italics"> Homo habilis</em>, and <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Homo erectus</em>&#8212;and those non-ancestral groups that can be considered &#8220;cousins&#8221; of modern humans, such as Neanderthals. Determining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult. In years past, when relatively few hominin fossils had been recovered, some scientists believed that considering them in order, from oldest to youngest, would demonstrate the course of evolution from early hominins to modern humans. In the past several years, however, many new fossils have been found, and it is clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found (and species named) represent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans.</p> <figure id="fig-ch29_07_03" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm81030592" alt="The evolutionary tree shows the relationship between humans and the great apes.

The oldest of these, <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em>, has been dated to nearly 7 million years ago. There is a single specimen of this genus, a skull that was a surface find in Chad. The fossil, informally called &#8220;Toumai,&#8221; is a mosaic of primitive and evolved characteristics, and it is unclear how this fossil fits with the picture given by molecular data, namely that the line leading to modern humans and modern chimpanzees apparently bifurcated about 6 million years ago.

In the intervening years, several more specimens of <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Ardipithecus</em>, classified as two different species, demonstrated that the organism was bipedal.

Mutations in mtDNA can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic divergence. The resulting evidence suggests that all modern humans have mtDNA inherited from a common ancestor that lived in Africa about 160,000 years ago. Another approach to the molecular understanding of human evolution is to examine the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son.

All people past and present, along with the australopithecines, are hominins. We share the adaptation of being habitually bipedal. The earliest australopithecines very likely did not evolve until 5 million years ago. The primate fossil record for this crucial transitional period leading to australopithecines is still sketchy and somewhat confusing. By about 2.5 million years ago, there were at least two evolutionary lines of hominins descended from early australopithecines.</p> </div> </div> </div> </body>
