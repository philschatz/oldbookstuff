Most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions. Oxidation and reduction occur in tandem. An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction. Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions, or <span class="term">redox reactions</span>.</p><div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1798739">Electrons and Energy</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id3112918">The removal of an electron from a molecule, oxidizing it, results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound. The electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom), does not remain unbonded, however, in the cytoplasm of a cell. Rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the second compound. The shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy from the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the potential energy of the second compound (the reduced compound). The transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most of the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons. The transfer of energy in the form of electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an incremental fashion&#8212;in small packages rather than in a single, destructive burst. This chapter focuses on the extraction of energy from food; you will see that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id2763612">Electron Carriers</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1405882">In living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: They bind and carry high-energy electrons between compounds in pathways. The principal electron carriers we will consider are derived from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides. These compounds can be easily reduced (that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they lose electrons). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (<a href="/#fig-ch07_01_01" data-target-id="fig-ch07_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>) is derived from vitamin B3, niacin.

Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell, which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able to handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the &#8220;energy currency&#8221; of the cell, and, like currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions similarly to a rechargeable battery.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1359897">When ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. The energy is used to do work by the cell, usually by the released phosphate binding to another molecule, activating it. For example, in the mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. Recall the active transport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that functions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions against their electrochemical gradients.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id2183864">ATP Structure and Function</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1595819">At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a ribose molecule and to a single phosphate group (<a href="/#fig-ch07_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch07_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA, and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA.

Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they are arranged in series, as they are in ADP and ATP. This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable.

During hydrolysis, water is split, or lysed, and the resulting hydrogen atom (H<sup class="sup">+</sup>) and a hydroxyl group (OH<sup class="sup">-</sup>) are added to the larger molecule. The hydrolysis of ATP produces ADP, together with an inorganic phosphate ion (P<sub class="sub">i</sub>), and the release of free energy. To carry out life processes, ATP is continuously broken down into ADP, and like a rechargeable battery, ADP is continuously regenerated into ATP by the reattachment of a third phosphate group. Water, which was broken down into its hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group during ATP hydrolysis, is regenerated when a third phosphate is added to the ADP molecule, reforming ATP.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1798236">Obviously, energy must be infused into the system to regenerate ATP. Where does this energy come from? In nearly every living thing on earth, the energy comes from the metabolism of glucose. In this way, ATP is a direct link between the limited set of exergonic pathways of glucose catabolism and the multitude of endergonic pathways that power living cells.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1560590">Phosphorylation</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id2348311">Recall that, in some chemical reactions, enzymes may bind to several substrates that react with each other on the enzyme, forming an intermediate complex. An intermediate complex is a temporary structure, and it allows one of the substrates (such as ATP) and reactants to more readily react with each other; in reactions involving ATP, ATP is one of the substrates and ADP is a product. During an endergonic chemical reaction, ATP forms an intermediate complex with the substrate and enzyme in the reaction. This intermediate complex allows the ATP to transfer its third phosphate group, with its energy, to the substrate, a process called phosphorylation. <span class="term">Phosphorylation</span> refers to the addition of the phosphate (~P).

Mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. In type 2 diabetes, for instance, the oxidation efficiency of NADH is reduced, impacting oxidative phosphorylation but not the other steps of respiration. Symptoms of mitochondrial diseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and loss of vision and hearing. Most affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases. Identifying and treating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession requires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical geneticists can be board certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with professional organizations devoted to the study of mitochondrial diseases, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine Society and the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disease.</p> </div></div> </div> <div class="summary section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1397107">Section Summary</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id2890552">ATP functions as the energy currency for cells. It allows the cell to store energy briefly and transport it within the cell to support endergonic chemical reactions. The structure of ATP is that of an RNA nucleotide with three phosphates attached. As ATP is used for energy, a phosphate group or two are detached, and either ADP or AMP is produced. Energy derived from glucose catabolism is used to convert ADP into ATP. When ATP is used in a reaction, the third phosphate is temporarily attached to a substrate in a process called phosphorylation. The two processes of ATP regeneration that are used in conjunction with glucose catabolism are substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation through the process of chemiosmosis.</p> </div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1473147">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1957993"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1276810"><p class="para" id="fs-id2197455">The energy currency used by cells is ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1785724" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">ATP</li> <li class="item">ADP</li> <li class="item">AMP</li> <li class="item">adenosine</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1470656"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1760308">A</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1419484"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2100818"><p class="para" id="fs-id1450216">A reducing chemical reaction ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id2962812" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">reduces the compound to a simpler form</li> <li class="item">adds an electron to the substrate</li> <li class="item">removes a hydrogen atom from the substrate</li> <li class="item">is a catabolic reaction</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id3078523"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1961659">B</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="free-response section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1787762">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2781180"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2642317"><p class="para" id="fs-id1262550">Why is it beneficial for cells to use ATP rather than energy directly from the bonds of carbohydrates?
