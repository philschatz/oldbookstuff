Why is water so important? It is because water is essential to life as we know it. Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on Earth. Approximately 70 percent of the human body is made up of water. Without it, life as we know it simply would not exist.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm208251152">The polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special properties that are intimately tied to the processes of life. Life originally evolved in a watery environment, and most of an organism&#8217;s cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell&#8217;s cytoplasm. Special properties of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive properties, and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of pH. Understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm174636784">Water&#8217;s Polarity</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm7526976">One of water&#8217;s important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules: the hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules (H<sub class="sub">2</sub>O) form polar covalent bonds. While there is no net charge to a water molecule, the polarity of water creates a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water&#8217;s properties of attraction. Water&#8217;s charges are generated because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, making it more likely that a shared electron would be found near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, thus generating the partial negative charge near the oxygen.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm211026512">As a result of water&#8217;s polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between water molecules, forming hydrogen bonds. Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions. A polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as <span class="term">hydrophilic</span> (hydro- = &#8220;water&#8221;; -philic = &#8220;loving&#8221;). In contrast, non-polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water, as shown in <a href="/#fig-ch02_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch02_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> and separate from it rather than dissolve in it, as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar (an acidic water solution). These nonpolar compounds are called <span class="term">hydrophobic</span> (hydro- = &#8220;water&#8221;; -phobic = &#8220;fearing&#8221;).</p> <figure id="fig-ch02_02_01" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm84896624" alt="Image shows oil droplets floating in water.

As water molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other liquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life. In liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other. The breaking of these bonds is caused by the motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system. When the heat is raised as water is boiled, the higher kinetic energy of the water molecules causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas (steam or water vapor). On the other hand, when the temperature of water is reduced and water freezes, the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that makes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon not seen in the solidification of other liquids.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm243938000">Water&#8217;s lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds are oriented as it freezes: the water molecules are pushed farther apart compared to liquid water. With most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes the lowering of kinetic energy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving the solid a greater density than the liquid.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm201091888">The lower density of ice, illustrated and pictured in <a href="/#fig-ch02_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch02_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, an anomaly, causes it to float at the surface of liquid water, such as in an iceberg or in the ice cubes in a glass of ice water. In lakes and ponds, ice will form on the surface of the water creating an insulating barrier that protects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing. Without this layer of insulating ice, plants and animals living in the pond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive. The detrimental effect of freezing on living organisms is caused by the expansion of ice relative to liquid water. The ice crystals that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes essential for the function of living cells, irreversibly damaging them. Cells can only survive freezing if the water in them is temporarily replaced by another liquid like glycerol.</p> <figure id="fig-ch02_02_02" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm220328160" alt="Ice floes float on ocean water near a mountain range that rises out of the water."> <img src="Figure_02_02_02.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="480"/> </span> <figcaption>Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water.

Water has the highest <span class="term">specific heat capacity</span> of any liquids. Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius. For water, this amount is one <span class="term">calorie</span>. It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool. In fact, the specific heat capacity of water is about five times more than that of sand. This explains why the land cools faster than the sea. Due to its high heat capacity, water is used by warm blooded animals to more evenly disperse heat in their bodies: it acts in a similar manner to a car&#8217;s cooling system, transporting heat from warm places to cool places, causing the body to maintain a more even temperature.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm191438880">Water&#8217;s Heat of Vaporization</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm126450912">Water also has a high <span class="term">heat of vaporization</span>, the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas. A considerable amount of heat energy (586 cal) is required to accomplish this change in water. This process occurs on the surface of water. As liquid water heats up, hydrogen bonding makes it difficult to separate the liquid water molecules from each other, which is required for it to enter its gaseous phase (steam). As a result, water acts as a heat sink or heat reservoir and requires much more heat to boil than does a liquid such as ethanol (grain alcohol), whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol molecules is weaker than water&#8217;s hydrogen bonding. Eventually, as water reaches its boiling point of 100&#176; Celsius (212&#176; Fahrenheit), the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules, and the kinetic energy (motion) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas. Even when below its boiling point, water&#8217;s individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize: this process is known as <span class="term">evaporation</span>.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm128609856">The fact that hydrogen bonds need to be broken for water to evaporate means that a substantial amount of energy is used in the process. As the water evaporates, energy is taken up by the process, cooling the environment where the evaporation is taking place. In many living organisms, including in humans, the evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows the organism to cool so that homeostasis of body temperature can be maintained.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm109112880">Water&#8217;s Solvent Properties</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm146772512">Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it. Therefore, water is referred to as a <span class="term">solvent</span>, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds. The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle with water molecules.

Before it overflows, the water forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property of <span class="term">cohesion</span>. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm90917008">Cohesion allows for the development of <span class="term">surface tension</span>, the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress. This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity. When a small scrap of paper is placed onto the droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet even though paper is denser (heavier) than the water. Cohesion and surface tension keep the hydrogen bonds of water molecules intact and support the item floating on the top.

This attraction is sometimes stronger than water&#8217;s cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes. Adhesion is observed when water &#8220;climbs&#8221; up the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than in the middle. This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it.

Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for the transport of water from the roots to the leaves in plants. These forces create a &#8220;pull&#8221; on the water column. This pull results from the tendency of water molecules being evaporated on the surface of the plant to stay connected to water molecules below them, and so they are pulled along. Plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from their roots to their leaves. Without these properties of water, plants would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved minerals they require.

It is a polar molecule, allowing for the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an excellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules cause the water to have a high heat capacity, meaning it takes a lot of added heat to raise its temperature. As the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water continually break and form anew. This allows for the overall temperature to remain stable, although energy is added to the system. Water also exhibits a high heat of vaporization, which is key to how organisms cool themselves by the evaporation of sweat. Water&#8217;s cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension, whereas its adhesive properties are seen as water rises inside capillary tubes. The pH value is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and is one of many chemical characteristics that is highly regulated in living organisms through homeostasis. Acids and bases can change pH values, but buffers tend to moderate the changes they cause. These properties of water are intimately connected to the biochemical and physical processes performed by living organisms, and life would be very different if these properties were altered, if it could exist at all.</p> </div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm211252192">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm114093728"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm136642288"><p class="para" id="fs-idm219302448">Which of the following statements is not true?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm138434512" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">Water is polar.</li> <li class="item">Water stabilizes temperature.</li> <li class="item">Water is essential for life.</li> <li class="item">Water is the most abundant molecule in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm172613408"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm83097808">D</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp3290112"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm237084144"><p class="para" id="fs-idm105911456">When acids are added to a solution, the pH should ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm28460352" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">decrease</li> <li class="item">increase</li> <li class="item">stay the same</li> <li class="item">cannot tell without testing</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm186836160"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm203646144">A</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm171817504"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm175531712"><p class="para" id="fs-idm168814736">A molecule that binds up excess hydrogen ions in a solution is called a(n) ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm122159936" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">acid</li> <li class="item">isotope</li> <li class="item">base</li> <li class="item">donator</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm172577152"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm219300752">C</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm135464096"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm189725504"><p class="para" id="fs-idm171721312">Which of the following statements is true?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm26890480" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">Acids and bases cannot mix together.</li> <li class="item">Acids and bases will neutralize each other.</li> <li class="item">Acids, but not bases, can change the pH of a solution.</li> <li class="item">Acids donate hydroxide ions (OH<sup class="sup">&#8211;</sup>); bases donate hydrogen ions (H<sup class="sup">+</sup>).</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm33846352"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm258855984">B</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="free-response section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm174496528">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm263715984"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm130064416"><p class="para" id="fs-idm143981984">Discuss how buffers help prevent drastic swings in pH.</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm134114416"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm215007456">Buffers absorb the free hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions that result from chemical reactions.
