It is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates in outer space (sunlight) and convert it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism. In brief, the energy of sunlight is captured and used to energize electrons, which are then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds? The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis almost 200 million years ago.</p><p class="para" id="fs-idm163325392">Plants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis (<a href="/#fig-ch08_01_01" data-target-id="fig-ch08_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called <span class="term">photoautotrophs</span> (literally, &#8220;self-feeders using light&#8221;). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed <span class="term">heterotrophs</span> (&#8220;other feeders&#8221;), because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlight&#8217;s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds; hence, they are referred to as <span class="term">chemoautotrophs</span>.</p> <figure id="fig-ch08_01_01" data-class=" "><figcaption>Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds via photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous areas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these (e) thermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem surrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopi that derive energy from the bacteria.

A lizard sunning itself on a cold day can use the sun&#8217;s energy to warm up. Photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy in solar radiation (the &#8220;photo-&#8221; part) as high-energy electrons in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the &#8220;-synthesis&#8221; part). Those carbohydrates are the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99 percent of Earth&#8217;s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (<a href="/#fig-ch08_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch08_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>), the wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer, and finally to wolf.</p> <figure id="fig-ch08_01_02"><figcaption>The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain.

After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P), simple carbohydrate molecules (which are high in energy) that can subsequently be converted into glucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules.

The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the <span class="term">mesophyll</span>. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called <span class="term">stomata</span> (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes.</p><p class="para" id="fs-idm56890608">In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a <span class="term">chloroplast</span>. For plants, chloroplast-containing cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called <span class="term">thylakoids</span>. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a <span class="term">pigment</span> (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the <span class="term">thylakoid lumen</span>.

In the <span class="term">light-dependent reactions</span>, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the <span class="term">light-independent reactions</span>, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drive the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, several enzymes of the light-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store the energy: These are referred to as energy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to light-independent reactions can be thought of as &#8220;full&#8221; because they are rich in energy. After the energy is released, the &#8220;empty&#8221; energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. <a href="/#fig-ch08_01_06" data-target-id="fig-ch08_01_06" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> illustrates the components inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.</p><figure id="fig-ch08_01_06"><figcaption>Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: light dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.
