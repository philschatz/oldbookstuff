This is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carbon&#8211;carbon or carbon&#8211;hydrogen bonds. Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (&#8220;water fearing&#8221;), or insoluble in water. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats. Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (<a href="/#fig-ch03_03_01" data-target-id="fig-ch03_03_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry when forming a protective layer over fur or feathers because of their water-repellant hydrophobic nature. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of all cellular membranes. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.</p><figure id="fig-ch03_03_01"><span class="media" id="fs-id1712156" alt="Photo shows a river otter swimming."> <img src="Figure_03_03_01.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="280"/> </span> <figcaption>Hydrophobic lipids in the fur of aquatic mammals, such as this river otter, protect them from the elements.

Glycerol is an organic compound (alcohol) with three carbons, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (OH) groups. Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which a carboxyl group is attached, hence the name &#8220;fatty acid.&#8221; The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36; most common are those containing 12&#8211;18 carbons. In a fat molecule, the fatty acids are attached to each of the three carbons of the glycerol molecule with an ester bond through an oxygen atom (<a href="/#fig-ch03_03_02" data-target-id="fig-ch03_03_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch03_03_02" class="span-all"><span class="media" id="fs-id2569082" alt="The structures of glycerol, a fatty acid, and a triacylglycerol are shown.

In triacylglycerol, a fatty acid is attached to each of glycerol&#8217;s three hydroxyl groups via the carboxyl group. A water molecule is lost in the reaction so the structure of the linkage is C-O-C, with an oxygen double bonded to the second carbon."> <img src="Figure_03_03_02.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="450"/> </span> <figcaption>Triacylglycerol is formed by the joining of three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone in a dehydration reaction.

The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called <span class="term">triacylglycerols</span> or <span class="term">triglycerides</span> because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a <span class="term">saturated fatty acid</span>, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Arachis hypogea,</em> the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id891930">Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid (<a href="/#fig-ch03_03_03" data-target-id="fig-ch03_03_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>)</p> <figure id="fig-ch03_03_03" class="span-all"><span class="media" id="fs-id1235407" alt="The structure of stearic acid is shown.

If there is one double bond in the molecule, then it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1066559">When a fatty acid has no double bonds, it is known as a saturated fatty acid because no more hydrogen may be added to the carbon atoms of the chain. A fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol. Long straight fatty acids with single bonds tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid (common in meat) and the fat with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fats. Mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell&#8217;s volume. In plants, fat or oil is stored in many seeds and is used as a source of energy during seedling development. Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">cis</em> unsaturated fatty acids. <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Cis</em> and <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">trans</em> indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond. If hydrogens are present in the same plane, it is referred to as a cis fat; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes, it is referred to as a <span class="term">trans fat</span>.The <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">cis </em>double bond causes a bend or a &#8220;kink&#8221; that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature (<a href="/#fig-ch03_03_05" data-target-id="fig-ch03_03_05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).

Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this hydrogenation process, double bonds of the <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">cis</em>- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the trans- conformation.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1447736">Margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats. Recent studies have shown that an increase in trans fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently banned the use of trans fats, and food labels are required to display the trans fat content.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id2890621">Omega Fatty Acids</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1958165">Essential fatty acids are fatty acids required but not synthesized by the human body.

Nutritionally important because the body does not make them, omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all of which are polyunsaturated. Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attacks, reduce triglycerides in the blood, lower blood pressure, and prevent thrombosis by inhibiting blood clotting. They also reduce inflammation, and may help reduce the risk of some cancers in animals.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1966110">Like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other &#8220;fatty&#8221; foods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Many vitamins are fat soluble, and fats serve as a long-term storage form of fatty acids: a source of energy. They also provide insulation for the body. Therefore, &#8220;healthy&#8221; fats in moderate amounts should be consumed on a regular basis.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1970730">Waxes</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1384512"><span class="term">Wax</span> covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants.

Although cholesterol is often spoken of in negative terms by lay people, it is necessary for proper functioning of the body. It is a component of the plasma membrane of animal cells and is found within the phospholipid bilayer.

Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats are a stored form of energy and are also known as triacylglycerols or triglycerides. Fats are made up of fatty acids and either glycerol or sphingosine. Fatty acids may be unsaturated or saturated, depending on the presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. If only single bonds are present, they are known as saturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids may have one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Phospholipids make up the matrix of membranes. They have a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group are attached. Steroids are another class of lipids. Their basic structure has four fused carbon rings.
