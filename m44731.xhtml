Recall that tissues are groups of similar cells group of similar cells carrying out related functions. These tissues combine to form organs&#8212;like the skin or kidney&#8212;that have specific, specialized functions within the body. Organs are organized into organ systems to perform functions; examples include the circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, and the digestive system, consisting of several organs, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas.

The ground substance is made of an organic substance (usually a protein) and an inorganic substance (usually a mineral or water). The principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast. This cell makes the fibers found in nearly all of the connective tissues. Fibroblasts are motile, able to carry out mitosis, and can synthesize whichever connective tissue is needed. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and, occasionally, leukocytes can be found in some of the tissues. Some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others. The <span class="term">matrix</span> in connective tissues gives the tissue its density. When a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers, it has proportionally a less dense matrix.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm109329920">The organic portion or protein fibers found in connective tissues are either collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers. Collagen fibers provide strength to the tissue, preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding tissues. Elastic fibers are made of the protein elastin; this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length and return to its original size and shape. Elastic fibers provide flexibility to the tissues. Reticular fibers are the third type of protein fiber found in connective tissues. This fiber consists of thin strands of collagen that form a network of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which it is connected.

The organic matrix is similar to the matrix material found in other connective tissues, including some amount of collagen and elastic fibers. This gives strength and flexibility to the tissue. The inorganic matrix consists of mineral salts&#8212;mostly calcium salts&#8212;that give the tissue hardness. Without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate inorganic material in the matrix, the tissue bends.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp181421152">There are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are active in making bone for growth and remodeling. Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they continue to live, but in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes. Osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone. Osteoclasts are active in breaking down bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to calcium stored in tissues. Osteoclasts are usually found on the surface of the tissue.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp87114896">Bone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy. Compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone. Compact bone is organized into subunits called <span class="term">osteons</span>, as illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch33_02_09" data-target-id="fig-ch33_02_09" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal, with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae. The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called <span class="term">canaliculi</span>; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells. Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called <span class="term">trabeculae</span> these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength. Over time, these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient. Bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate animals, providing structure to the animal and points of attachment for tendons.</p> <figure id="fig-ch33_02_09"><span class="media" id="fs-idp113611984" alt=" Illustration A shows a cross section of a long bone with wide protrusions at either end.

Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample: the average number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter. Erythrocytes are consistently the same size in a species, but vary in size between species. For example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5 &#181;l, a dog is close at 7.0 &#181;l, but a cat&#8217;s RBC diameter is 5.9 &#181;l. Sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 &#181;l. Mammalian erythrocytes lose their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made. Fish, amphibian, and avian red blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondria throughout the cell&#8217;s life.

Different types of lymphocytes make antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells and they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria that has entered the body. Another leukocyte that is found in the peripheral blood is the monocyte. Monocytes give rise to phagocytic macrophages that clean up dead and damaged cells in the body, whether they are foreign or from the host animal. Two additional leukocytes in the blood are eosinophils and basophils&#8212;both help to facilitate the inflammatory response.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp50420432">The slightly granular material among the cells is a cytoplasmic fragment of a cell in the bone marrow.

Constriction of smooth muscle occurs under involuntary, autonomic nervous control and in response to local conditions in the tissues. Smooth muscle tissue is also called non-striated as it lacks the banded appearance of skeletal and cardiac muscle. The walls of blood vessels, the tubes of the digestive system, and the tubes of the reproductive systems are composed of mostly smooth muscle.</p><figure id="fig-ch33_02_12" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp93008096" alt="The smooth muscle cells are long and arranged in parallel bands.

Cardiac muscle cells have striations, but, unlike the multinucleate skeletal cells, they have only one nucleus.

These muscle cells are relatively long and have multiple nuclei along the edge of the cell. Skeletal muscle is under voluntary, somatic nervous system control and is found in the muscles that move bones. <a href="/#fig-ch33_02_12" data-target-id="fig-ch33_02_12" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> illustrates the histology of skeletal muscle.</p></div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idm34709440">Cardiac Muscle</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm56260496">Cardiac muscle, shown in <a href="/#fig-ch33_02_12" data-target-id="fig-ch33_02_12" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, is found only in the heart. Like skeletal muscle, it has cross striations in its cells, but cardiac muscle has a single, centrally located nucleus. Cardiac muscle is not under voluntary control but can be influenced by the autonomic nervous system to speed up or slow down. An added feature to cardiac muscle cells is a line than extends along the end of the cell as it abuts the next cardiac cell in the row. This line is called an intercalated disc: it assists in passing electrical impulse efficiently from one cell to the next and maintains the strong connection between neighboring cardiac cells.</p></div> </div><div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp37267440">Nervous Tissues</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm57909536">Nervous tissues are made of cells specialized to receive and transmit electrical impulses from specific areas of the body and to send them to specific locations in the body.

Projections from the cell body are either dendrites specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses. Some glial cells are also shown. Astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently. Other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste requirements of the neuron. Some of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue. A nerve consists of neurons and glial cells.</p> <figure id="fig-ch33_02_13"><span class="media" id="fs-idp69706192" alt="Illustration shows a neuron which has an oval cell body.
