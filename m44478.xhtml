The physical expression of characteristics is accomplished through the expression of genes carried on chromosomes. The genetic makeup of peas consists of two similar or homologous copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Each pair of homologous chromosomes has the same linear order of genes. In other words, peas are diploid organisms in that they have two copies of each chromosome. The same is true for many other plants and for virtually all animals. Diploid organisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid gametes, which contain one copy of each homologous chromosome that unite at fertilization to create a diploid zygote.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1386877">For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called <span class="term">alleles</span>. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id2075303">Phenotypes and Genotypes</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1983358">Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its <span class="term">phenotype</span>. An organism&#8217;s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both physically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called its <span class="term">genotype</span>. Mendel&#8217;s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. When true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had green pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F<sub class="sub">1</sub> hybrid offspring had yellow pods. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green pods was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F<sub class="sub">2</sub> offspring. Therefore, the F<sub class="sub">1</sub> plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow pods.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2121321">The P<sub class="sub">1</sub> plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that are <span class="term">homozygous</span> at a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes. Mendel&#8217;s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. When P<sub class="sub">1</sub> plants with contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were <span class="term">heterozygous</span> for the contrasting trait, meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id846600">Dominant and Recessive Alleles</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1432196">Our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F<sub class="sub">1</sub> heterozygous offspring were identical to one of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles was dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosome pairs. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype).

Furthermore, we will use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles, respectively. Therefore, we would refer to the genotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers as <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">VV</em>, a homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers as <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">vv</em>, and a heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers as <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Vv</em>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1804658">The Punnett Square Approach for a Monohybrid Cross</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id2491691">When fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic, the process is called a <span class="term">monohybrid</span> cross, and the resulting offspring are monohybrids. Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic. On the basis of his results in F<sub class="sub">1</sub> and F<sub class="sub">2</sub> generations, Mendel postulated that each parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1552731">To demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea seeds. The dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">YY</em> for the plants with yellow seeds and <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">yy</em> for the plants with green seeds, respectively. A <span class="term">Punnett square</span>, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies. To prepare a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid, representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes. Then the combinations of egg and sperm are made in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are combining. Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg, that could result from this mating. Because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant or recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case, only one genotype is possible. All offspring are <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Yy</em> and have yellow seeds (<a href="/#fig-ch12_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch12_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch12_02_01"> <span class="media" id="fs-id1799175" alt="This illustration shows a monohybrid cross. In the P generation, one parent has a dominant yellow phenotype and the genotype YY, and the other parent has the recessive green phenotype and the genotype yy.

Self-pollination of the F_{1} generation results in an F_{2} generation with a 3 to 1 ratio of yellow to green peas.

Therefore, the offspring can potentially have one of four allele combinations: <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">YY</em>, <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Yy</em>, <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">yY</em>, or <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">yy</em> (<a href="/#fig-ch12_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch12_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Notice that there are two ways to obtain the <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Yy</em> genotype: a <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Y</em> from the egg and a <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">y</em> from the sperm, or a <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">y</em> from the egg and a <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Y</em> from the sperm. Both of these possibilities must be counted. Recall that Mendel&#8217;s pea-plant characteristics behaved in the same way in reciprocal crosses. Therefore, the two possible heterozygous combinations produce offspring that are genotypically and phenotypically identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving from different parents. They are grouped together. Because fertilization is a random event, we expect each combination to be equally likely and for the offspring to exhibit a ratio of <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">YY</em>:<em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Yy</em>:<em class="emphasis" effect="italics">yy</em> genotypes of 1:2:1 (<a href="/#fig-ch12_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch12_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Furthermore, because the <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">YY</em> and <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Yy</em> offspring have yellow seeds and are phenotypically identical, applying the sum rule of probability, we expect the offspring to exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow:1 green. Indeed, working with large sample sizes, Mendel observed approximately this ratio in every F<sub class="sub">2</sub> generation resulting from crosses for individual traits.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1883145">Mendel validated these results by performing an F<sub class="sub">3</sub> cross in which he self-crossed the dominant- and recessive-expressing F<sub class="sub">2</sub> plants.

When he self-crossed the F<sub class="sub">2</sub> plants expressing yellow seeds, he found that one-third of the plants bred true, and two-thirds of the plants segregated at a 3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds. In this case, the true-breeding plants had homozygous (<em class="emphasis" effect="italics">YY</em>) genotypes, whereas the segregating plants corresponded to the heterozygous (<em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Yy</em>) genotype. When these plants self-fertilized, the outcome was just like the F<sub class="sub">1</sub> self-fertilizing cross.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1837292">The Test Cross Distinguishes the Dominant Phenotype</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1404094">Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote. Called the <span class="term">test cross</span>, this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders. In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic.

Such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as &#8220;carriers.&#8221; Further genetic studies in other plants and animals have shown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics still hold true. In the sections to follow, we consider some of the extensions of Mendelism.

Because human males need to inherit only one recessive mutant X allele to be affected, X-linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males. Females must inherit recessive X-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to express the trait. When they inherit one recessive X-linked mutant allele and one dominant X-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected. Carrier females can manifest mild forms of the trait due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X chromosomes. However, female carriers can contribute the trait to their sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait, or they can contribute the recessive allele to their daughters, resulting in the daughters being carriers of the trait (<a href="/#fig-ch12_02_11" data-target-id="fig-ch12_02_11" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).

Occasionally, a nonfunctional allele for an essential gene can arise by mutation and be transmitted in a population as long as individuals with this allele also have a wild-type, functional copy. The wild-type allele functions at a capacity sufficient to sustain life and is therefore considered to be dominant over the nonfunctional allele. However, consider two heterozygous parents that have a genotype of wild-type/nonfunctional mutant for a hypothetical essential gene. In one quarter of their offspring, we would expect to observe individuals that are homozygous recessive for the nonfunctional allele. Because the gene is essential, these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization, die <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">in utero</em>, or die later in life, depending on what life stage requires this gene. An inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non-lethal phenotype is referred to as <span class="term">recessive lethal</span>.</p><p class="para" id="fs-id1381737">For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous, only wild-type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed. The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1. In other instances, the recessive lethal allele might also exhibit a dominant (but not lethal) phenotype in the heterozygote. For instance, the recessive lethal <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Curly</em> allele in <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Drosophila</em> affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote.</p><p class="para" id="fs-id1442169">A single copy of the wild-type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival. The <span class="term">dominant lethal</span> inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote; this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age. Individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form. Dominant lethal alleles are very rare because, as you might expect, the allele only lasts one generation and is not transmitted. However, just as the recessive lethal allele might not immediately manifest the phenotype of death, dominant lethal alleles also might not be expressed until adulthood. Once the individual reaches reproductive age, the allele may be unknowingly passed on, resulting in a delayed death in both generations. An example of this in humans is Huntington&#8217;s disease, in which the nervous system gradually wastes away (<a href="/#fig-ch12_02_12" data-target-id="fig-ch12_02_12" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). People who are heterozygous for the dominant Huntington allele (<em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Hh</em>) will inevitably develop the fatal disease.

Incomplete dominance describes situations in which the heterozygote exhibits a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous phenotypes. Codominance describes the simultaneous expression of both of the alleles in the heterozygote. Although diploid organisms can only have two alleles for any given gene, it is common for more than two alleles of a gene to exist in a population. In humans, as in many animals and some plants, females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Genes that are present on the X but not the Y chromosome are said to be X-linked, such that males only inherit one allele for the gene, and females inherit two. Finally, some alleles can be lethal.
