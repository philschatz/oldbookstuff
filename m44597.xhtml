A virus must attach to a living cell, be taken inside, manufacture its proteins and copy its genome, and find a way to escape the cell so that the virus can infect other cells. Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host. Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called <span class="term">permissive</span>. For most viruses, the molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach. Also, metabolic and host cell immune response differences seen in different cell types based on differential gene expression are a likely factor in which cells a virus may target for replication. The permissive cell must make the substances that the virus needs or the virus will not be able to replicate there.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm73024256">Steps of Virus Infections</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm96953392">A virus must use cell processes to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, called <span class="term">cytopathic</span> (causing cell damage) effects, can change cell functions or even destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, die through <span class="term">lysis</span> (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death or &#8220;cell suicide&#8221;), releasing all progeny virions at once. The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus. Many animal viruses, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as <span class="term">budding</span>, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make it impossible for the cells to function normally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release (<a href="/#fig-ch21_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch21_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idm14940416">Attachment</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm143481568">A virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of this interaction determines the host&#8212;and the cells within the host&#8212;that can be infected by a particular virus. This can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks, where each key will fit only one specific lock.</p> <div class="interactive" id="fs-idm24896976"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-idm60005600" alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="influenza.png" data-mime-type="image/png" width="120"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-idp135135216">This <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/influenza" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/influenza">video</a> explains how influenza attacks the body.</p> </div></div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idm43800048">Entry</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idp37712480">The nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell naked, leaving the capsid outside the cell. Plant and animal viruses can enter through endocytosis, in which the cell membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus. Some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid is degraded, and the viral nucleic acid is released, which then becomes available for replication and transcription.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idm200870256">Replication and Assembly</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm16331920">The replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host cell proteins and enzymes to make additional DNA that is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then used to direct protein synthesis. RNA viruses usually use the RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA directs the host cell to synthesize viral enzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions. Of course, there are exceptions to this pattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral genes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins. Retroviruses, such as HIV, have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed into DNA, which then is incorporated into the host cell genome. They are within group VI of the Baltimore classification scheme. To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse transcriptase that transcribes an RNA template to DNA. Reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cells&#8212;the needed enzyme reverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells. The fact that HIV produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes. These drugs, including the reverse transcriptase inhibitor <span class="term">AZT</span>, inhibit HIV replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host&#8217;s metabolism. This approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat HIV and has been effective at reducing the number of infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in many HIV-infected individuals.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp131787088">Egress</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm132883760">The last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced in the host organism, where they are able to infect adjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle.

This feature of a virus makes it specific to one or a few species of life on Earth. On the other hand, so many different types of viruses exist on Earth that nearly every living organism has its own set of viruses that tries to infect its cells. Even the smallest and simplest of cells, prokaryotic bacteria, may be attacked by specific types of viruses.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm50042624">Bacteriophages</h1> <figure id="fig-ch21_02_02" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm45937760" alt="The micrograph shows hexagonal bacteriophage capsids attached to a host bacterial cell by slender stalks."> <img src="Figure_21_02_02.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="255"/> </span> <figcaption>This transmission electron micrograph shows bacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell.

When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions, the infection is said to be <span class="term">productive</span>. If the virions are released by bursting the cell, the virus replicates by means of a <span class="term">lytic cycle</span> (<a href="/#fig-ch21_02_03" data-target-id="fig-ch21_02_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4, which infects <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Escherichia coli</em> found in the human intestinal tract. Sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without being released. For example, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of a <span class="term">lysogenic cycle</span> (<a href="/#fig-ch21_02_03" data-target-id="fig-ch21_02_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>), and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell. When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome, it is called a <span class="term">prophage</span>. An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the &#955; (lambda) virus, which also infects the <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">E</em>. <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">coli</em> bacterium. Viruses that infect plant or animal cells may also undergo infections where they are not producing virions for long periods. An example is the animal herpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans. In a process called <span class="term">latency</span>, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates. Even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages. Latency will be described in more detail below.</p> <div class="art-connection" id="fs-idp30136512"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Art Connection</div> <figure id="fig-ch21_02_03" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm18369792" alt="The bacteriophage lytic cycle begins when the phage attaches via a slender stalk to the host cell.

Non-enveloped or &#8220;naked&#8221; animal viruses may enter cells in two different ways. As a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. An alternative method of cell penetration used by non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the host cell membrane. The viral genome is then &#8220;injected&#8221; into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages. Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or <span class="term">fusion</span>. Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non-enveloped viruses. On the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. These viruses, which include HIV among others, use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus releasing the genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm. </p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp63812432">After making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the cell. As we have already discussed using the example of HIV, enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane as they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cell&#8217;s plasma membrane in the process. On the other hand, non-enveloped viral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are released together. </p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm68911200">As you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. Some of them follow the classic pattern of <span class="term">acute disease</span>, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection. Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza. Other viruses cause long-term <span class="term">chronic infections</span>, such as the virus causing hepatitis C, whereas others, like herpes simplex virus, only cause <span class="term">intermittent</span> symptoms. Still other viruses, such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7, which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have an <span class="term">asymptomatic infection</span>.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm53346992">In hepatitis C infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage. The damage is so low that infected individuals are often unaware that they are infected, and many infections are detected only by routine blood work on patients with risk factors such as intravenous drug use. On the other hand, since many of the symptoms of viral diseases are caused by immune responses, a lack of symptoms is an indication of a weak immune response to the virus. This allows for the virus to escape elimination by the immune system and persist in individuals for years, all the while producing low levels of progeny virions in what is known as a chronic viral disease. Chronic infection of the liver by this virus leads to a much greater chance of developing liver cancer, sometimes as much as 30 years after the initial infection.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm170248272">As already discussed, herpes simplex virus can remain in a state of latency in nervous tissue for months, even years. As the virus &#8220;hides&#8221; in the tissue and makes few if any viral proteins, there is nothing for the immune response to act against, and immunity to the virus slowly declines. Under certain conditions, including various types of physical and psychological stress, the latent herpes simplex virus may be reactivated and undergo a lytic replication cycle in the skin, causing the lesions associated with the disease. Once virions are produced in the skin and viral proteins are synthesized, the immune response is again stimulated and resolves the skin lesions in a few days by destroying viruses in the skin. As a result of this type of replicative cycle, appearances of cold sores and genital herpes outbreaks only occur intermittently, even though the viruses remain in the nervous tissue for life. Latent infections are common with other herpesviruses as well, including the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox. After having a chickenpox infection in childhood, the varicella-zoster virus can remain latent for many years and reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as &#8220;shingles&#8221; (<a href="/#fig-ch21_02_04" data-target-id="fig-ch21_02_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" effect="bold">ab</strong>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch21_02_04" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idm65403200" alt="Part a shows a micrograph of the varicella-zoster virus, which has an icosahedral capsid surrounded by an irregularly shaped envelope.

You have already learned about one of these, the tobacco mosaic virus. As plant viruses have a cell wall to protect their cells, these viruses do not use receptor-mediated endocytosis to enter host cells as is seen with animal viruses. For many plant viruses to be transferred from plant to plant, damage to some of the plants&#8217; cells must occur to allow the virus to enter a new host. This damage is often caused by weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. Additionally, plant offspring may inherit viral diseases from parent plants. Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected plant&#8217;s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen.

A viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or nonproductive, which means that the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. They have two different modes of replication: the lytic cycle, where the virus replicates and bursts out of the bacteria, and the lysogenic cycle, which involves the incorporation of the viral genome into the bacterial host genome. Animal viruses cause a variety of infections, with some causing chronic symptoms (hepatitis C), some intermittent symptoms (latent viruses such a herpes simplex virus 1), and others that cause very few symptoms, if any (human herpesviruses 6 and 7).
