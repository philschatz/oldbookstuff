The deuterostomes, whose name translates as &#8220;second mouth,&#8221; consist of two phyla: Chordata and Echinodermata. Echinoderms are invertebrate marine animals that have pentaradial symmetry and a spiny body covering, a group that includes sea stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.

In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal&#8217;s lifetime. In vertebrates, the notochord is present during embryonic development, at which time it induces the development of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. The notochord, however, is not found in the postnatal stage of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (that is, the spine).</p> <div class="note" id="fs-idp92125456" data-class="art-connection"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Art Connection</div> <figure id="fig-ch29_01_02" data-class=" "><figcaption>In chordates, four common features appear at some point during development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-idm7249664" data-alt="The illustration shows a fish-shaped chordate.

The nerve cord found in most chordate embryos develops into the brain and spinal cord, which compose the central nervous system.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm45223584"><span class="term">Pharyngeal slits</span> are openings in the pharynx (the region just posterior to the mouth) that extend to the outside environment. In organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding. Some invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food out of the water that enters the mouth. In vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, into jaw supports. In tetrapods, the slits are modified into components of the ear and tonsils. <span class="term">Tetrapod</span> literally means &#8220;four-footed,&#8221; which refers to the phylogenetic history of various groups that evolved accordingly, even though some now possess fewer than two pairs of walking appendages.

The name tunicate derives from the cellulose-like carbohydrate material, called the tunic, which covers the outer body of tunicates. Although adult tunicates are classified as chordates, they do not have a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, or a post-anal tail, although they do have pharyngeal slits. The larval form, however, possesses all four structures. Most tunicates are hermaphrodites. Tunicate larvae hatch from eggs inside the adult tunicate&#8217;s body. After hatching, a tunicate larva swims for a few days until it finds a suitable surface on which it can attach, usually in a dark or shaded location. It then attaches via the head to the surface and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form, at which point the notochord, nerve cord, and tail disappear.</p> <figure id="fig-ch29_01_03" data-class=" "><figcaption>(a) This photograph shows a colony of the tunicate <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Botrylloides violaceus</em>.

The primary foods of tunicates are plankton and detritus. Seawater enters the tunicate&#8217;s body through its incurrent siphon. Suspended material is filtered out of this water by a mucous net (pharyngeal slits) and is passed into the intestine via the action of cilia. The anus empties into the excurrent siphon, which expels wastes and water.
