While humans use words and body language to communicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before &#8220;making the decision&#8221; to send the message on to other neurons.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm306684336">Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm42661904">For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or &#8216;resting&#8217; membrane charge.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idm92021888">Neuronal Charged Membranes</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm247384272">The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch35_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch35_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the <span class="term">membrane potential</span>.</p> <figure id="fig-ch35_02_01" data-class=" "><figcaption>Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage.

This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in <a href="/#tab-ch35_02_01" data-target-id="tab-ch35_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. The difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K<sup class="sup">+</sup>) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential (<a href="/#fig-ch35_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch35_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). When the membrane is at rest, K<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the concentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement. In neurons, potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels. Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential, once established. Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions into the cell while removing three Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions per ATP consumed. As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid. It should be noted that calcium ions (Cl<sup class="sup">&#8211;</sup>) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm.</p><table id="tab-ch35_02_01" summary=""><caption>The resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations inside and outside the cell.</caption><thead> <tr> <td>Ion Concentration Inside and Outside Neurons</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ion</td> <td>Extracellular concentration (mM)</td> <td>Intracellular concentration (mM)</td> <td>Ratio outside/inside</td> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>Na<sup class="sup">+</sup></td> <td>145</td> <td>12</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr> <td>K+</td> <td>4</td> <td>155</td> <td>0.026</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cl<sup class="sup">&#8722;</sup></td> <td>120</td> <td>4</td> <td>30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Organic anions (A&#8722;)</td> <td>&#8212;</td> <td>100</td> <td/> </tr> </tbody></table><figure id="fig-ch35_02_02" data-class=" "><figcaption>The (a) resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations of Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> and K<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions inside and outside the cell.

Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter. Transmission of a signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an <span class="term">action potential</span>. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron&#8217;s dendrites, ion channels open. At excitatory synapses, this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in <span class="term">depolarization</span> of the membrane&#8212;a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential (-55 mV). Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> channels in the axon hillock open, allowing positive ions to enter the cell (<a href="/#fig-ch35_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch35_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> and <a href="/#fig-ch35_02_03" data-target-id="fig-ch35_02_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Once the sodium channels open, the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about +40 mV. Action potentials are considered an "all-or nothing" event, in that, once the threshold potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes. Once depolarization is complete, the cell must now "reset" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential. To accomplish this, the Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> channels close and cannot be opened. This begins the neuron's <span class="term">refractory period</span>, in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open. At the same time, voltage-gated K<sup class="sup">+</sup> channels open, allowing K<sup class="sup">+</sup> to leave the cell. As K<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes negative. The diffusion of K<sup class="sup">+</sup> out of the cell actually <span class="term">hyperpolarizes</span> the cell, in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential. At this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential. Eventually the extra K<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels, bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state, back to its resting membrane potential. </p><div class="note" id="fs-idm183942256" data-class="art-connection"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Art Connection</div> <p class="para" id="eip-idp10005600"> <figure id="fig-ch35_02_03" data-class=" "><figcaption>The formation of an action potential can be divided into five steps: (1) A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron causes the target cell to depolarize toward the threshold potential.

The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon&#8217;s resistance to current leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier, illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch35_02_05" data-target-id="fig-ch35_02_05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> and K<sup class="sup">+</sup> channels. Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon. This &#8216;jumping&#8217; of the action potential from one node to the next is called <span class="term">saltatory conduction</span>. If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon, the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> and K<sup class="sup">+</sup> channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points.

For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> channels to open. Na<sup class="sup">+</sup> enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize.

Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission. For example, some drugs that are given to Alzheimer&#8217;s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. This inhibition of the enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine.

The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses. In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually physically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell to the next. In addition to the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP, can diffuse through the large gap junction pores.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm19383344">There are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses. Because chemical synapses depend on the release of neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal, there is an approximately one millisecond delay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion channels. Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional. Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast, is virtually instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes), and some electrical synapses are bidirectional. Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked, and they are important for synchronizing the electrical activity of a group of neurons. For example, electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave sleep, and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm245743248">Signal Summation</h1><p class="para" id="fs-idm98199488">Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential.

The disease begins with muscle weakening and lack of coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control speech, breathing, and swallowing; in the end, the disease can lead to paralysis. At that point, patients require assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate. Several special technologies have been developed to allow &#8220;locked-in&#8221; patients to communicate with the rest of the world. One technology, for example, allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek. These sentences can then be read aloud by a computer.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm8955264">A relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with ALS, to communicate and retain a degree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and is illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch35_02_09" data-target-id="fig-ch35_02_09" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. This technology sounds like something out of science fiction: it allows paralyzed patients to control a computer using only their thoughts. There are several forms of BCI. Some forms use EEG recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull. These recordings contain information from large populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer. Other forms of BCI require the implantation of an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor cortex. This form of BCI, while more invasive, is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from one or more neurons. These signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the signal and feed it to a tool&#8212;such as a cursor on a computer screen. This means that a patient with ALS can use e-mail, read the Internet, and communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm (even though the paralyzed patient cannot make that bodily movement). Recent advances have allowed a paralyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to control a robotic arm and even to feed herself coffee using BCI technology.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm206604448">Despite the amazing advancements in BCI technology, it also has limitations.

They can be weakened or strengthened. They can be broken, and new synapses can be made. Synaptic plasticity allows for these changes, which are all needed for a functioning nervous system. In fact, synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory. Two processes in particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur in synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region that is involved in storing memories.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idm255135008">Long-term Potentiation (LTP)</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm118440240"><span class="term">Long-term potentiation (LTP)</span> is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection. LTP is based on the Hebbian principle: cells that fire together wire together. There are various mechanisms, none fully understood, behind the synaptic strengthening seen with LTP. One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor, called NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, shown in <a href="/#fig-ch35_02_10" data-target-id="fig-ch35_02_10" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions; however, when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession (either from one neuron or multiple neurons), the magnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell. Next, Ca<sup class="sup">2+</sup> ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor, called AMPA (&#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane, since activated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell. So, the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane, it will have a larger excitatory effect (EPSP) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these AMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell. The insertion of additional AMPA receptors strengthens the synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Some drugs of abuse co-opt the LTP pathway, and this synaptic strengthening can lead to addiction.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idm147232736">Long-term Depression (LTD)</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm193185040"><span class="term">Long-term depression (LTD)</span> is essentially the reverse of LTP: it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection. One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors. In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA receptors initiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch35_02_10" data-target-id="fig-ch35_02_10" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just as important for learning and memory as LTP. The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes the synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.</p><figure id="fig-ch35_02_10" data-class=" "><figcaption>Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly stimulated. This stimulation causes a calcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. The next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell, it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus depolarizing the membrane more efficiently. LTD occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low firing rate of the presynaptic neuron). The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein phosphatase 1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. This makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-idm209149696" data-alt="Illustration shows the mechanism of LTP and LTD. Normally, the NMDA receptor in the postsynaptic neuron is activated by glutamate binding, but only after depolarization removes an inhibitory magnesium ion. Once the magnesium is removed, calcium can enter the cell. In response to an increase in intracellular calcium, AMPA receptors are inserted into the plasma membrane, which amplifies the signal resulting in LTP. LDP occurs when low-frequency stimulation results in the activation of a different calcium-signaling cascade that causes AMPA receptors to be removed from the plasma membrane. As a result, the nerve cell becomes less responsive to glutamate."> <img src="Figure_35_02_10.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" alt="Illustration shows the mechanism of LTP and LTD.

Voltage-gated ion channels control the movement of ions into and out of a neuron. When a neuronal membrane is depolarized to at least the threshold of excitation, an action potential is fired. The action potential is then propagated along a myelinated axon to the axon terminals. In a chemical synapse, the action potential causes release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. Through binding to postsynaptic receptors, the neurotransmitter can cause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing, respectively, the postsynaptic membrane. In electrical synapses, the action potential is directly communicated to the postsynaptic cell through gap junctions&#8212;large channel proteins that connect the pre-and postsynaptic membranes. Synapses are not static structures and can be strengthened and weakened.
