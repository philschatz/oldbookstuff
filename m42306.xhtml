Because the glass rod is an insulator, it must actually touch the electroscope to transfer charge to or from it. (Note that the extra positive charges reside on the surface of the glass rod as a result of rubbing it with silk before starting the experiment.) Since only electrons move in metals, we see that they are attracted to the top of the electroscope. There, some are transferred to the positive rod by touch, leaving the electroscope with a net positive charge.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1839802"><span class="term" id="import-auto-id1794995">Electrostatic repulsion</span> in the leaves of the charged electroscope separates them.

Polarization is the separation of charges in an object that remains neutral. If the spheres are now separated (before the rod is pulled away), each sphere will have a net charge. Note that the object closest to the charged rod receives an opposite charge when charged by induction. Note also that no charge is removed from the charged rod, so that this process can be repeated without depleting the supply of excess charge.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1444773">Another method of charging by induction is shown in <a href="#import-auto-id2122248" data-target-id="import-auto-id2122248" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. The neutral metal sphere is polarized when a charged rod is brought near it. The sphere is then grounded, meaning that a conducting wire is run from the sphere to the ground. Since the earth is large and most ground is a good conductor, it can supply or accept excess charge easily. In this case, electrons are attracted to the sphere through a wire called the ground wire, because it supplies a conducting path to the ground. The ground connection is broken before the charged rod is removed, leaving the sphere with an excess charge opposite to that of the rod. Again, an opposite charge is achieved when charging by induction and the charged rod loses none of its excess charge.</p> <figure id="import-auto-id1633568"><figcaption>Charging by induction.

The pieces of straw attracted to polished amber are neutral, for example. If you run a plastic comb through your hair, the charged comb can pick up neutral pieces of paper. <a href="#import-auto-id1973664" data-target-id="import-auto-id1973664" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> shows how the polarization of atoms and molecules in neutral objects results in their attraction to a charged object.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1890593">When a charged rod is brought near a neutral substance, an insulator in this case, the distribution of charge in atoms and molecules is shifted slightly. Opposite charge is attracted nearer the external charged rod, while like charge is repelled. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, the repulsion of like charges is weaker than the attraction of unlike charges, and so there is a net attraction. Thus a positively charged glass rod attracts neutral pieces of paper, as will a negatively charged rubber rod. Some molecules, like water, are polar molecules. Polar molecules have a natural or inherent separation of charge, although they are neutral overall. Polar molecules are particularly affected by other charged objects and show greater polarization effects than molecules with naturally uniform charge distributions.</p> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1824436" data-type="check-understanding"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Check Your Understanding</div><div class="problem" id="fs-id2044642"> <p class="para" id="eip-id1639352">Can you explain the attraction of water to the charged rod in the figure below? <figure id="import-auto-id1559308"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1599968" data-alt="Water flowing out of a glass pipette changes its course when a charged rod is brought close to it."> <img src="Figure_19_02_06a.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" alt="Water flowing out of a glass pipette changes its course when a charged rod is brought close to it." width="200"/> </span> </figure></p> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1890450"> <div class="title"><span class="label"/>Answer</div> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1924776">Water molecules are polarized, giving them slightly positive and slightly negative sides.
