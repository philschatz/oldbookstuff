It appears to have been very successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually, and in many animals, it is the only mode of reproduction. And yet, scientists recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, creating offspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system. If the parent organism is successfully occupying a habitat, offspring with the same traits would be similarly successful. There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can produce offspring whenever circumstances are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eggs. These methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. Indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, in asexual populations, every individual is capable of reproduction. In sexual populations, the males are not producing the offspring themselves, so in theory an asexual population could grow twice as fast.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1491929">However, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare. Why is sexuality (and meiosis) so common? This is one of the important unanswered questions in biology and has been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century. There are several possible explanations, one of which is that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and reproduction of the population. Thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an otherwise similar asexually reproducing population. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. This is the ultimate source of variation in sexual organisms, but in addition, those different mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are mixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-id1734487" data-class="evolution"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Evolution Connection</div> <p class="para" id="fs-id1250011"><span class="title">The Red Queen Hypothesis</span>It is not in dispute that sexual reproduction provides evolutionary advantages to organisms that employ this mechanism to produce offspring. But why, even in the face of fairly stable conditions, does sexual reproduction persist when it is more difficult and costly for individual organisms? Variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.<sup class="sup"><div class="footnote" id="fn-ch11mod02-01"><p class="para" id="eip-id2890339">Leigh Van Valen, &#8220;A New Evolutionary Law,&#8221; <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Evolutionary Theory</em> 1 (1973): 1&#8211;30</p></div></sup> The concept was named in reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's book, <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Through the Looking-Glass</em>.</p><p class="para" id="fs-id1801212">All species co-evolve with other organisms; for example predators evolve with their prey, and parasites evolve with their hosts. Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species an edge over close competitors, predators, parasites, or even prey. The only method that will allow a co-evolving species to maintain its own share of the resources is to also continually improve its fitness. As one species gains an advantage, this increases selection on the other species; they must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to improve rapidly. Species that cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen&#8217;s catchphrase was, &#8220;It takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place.&#8221; This is an apt description of co-evolution between competing species.</p> </div><div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1735901">Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1723190">Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual <span class="term">life cycles</span>. What happens between these two events depends on the organism. The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half.

Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular haploid life stage. Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the diploid state (<a href="/#fig-ch11-02-01" data-target-id="fig-ch11-02-01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch11-02-01" data-class=" "><figcaption>In animals, sexually reproducing adults form haploid gametes from diploid germ cells.

In other plants, such as ferns, both the gametophyte and sporophyte plants are free-living; however, the sporophyte is much larger. In seed plants, such as magnolia trees and daisies, the gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and, in the case of the female gametophyte, is completely retained within the sporophyte.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1397516">Sexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms. However, at some point in each type of life cycle, meiosis produces haploid cells that will fuse with the haploid cell of another organism. The mechanisms of variation&#8212;crossover, random assortment of homologous chromosomes, and random fertilization&#8212;are present in all versions of sexual reproduction. The fact that nearly every multicellular organism on Earth employs sexual reproduction is strong evidence for the benefits of producing offspring with unique gene combinations, though there are other possible benefits as well.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1886470">Section Summary</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1321733">Nearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction. The variation introduced into the reproductive cells by meiosis appears to be one of the advantages of sexual reproduction that has made it so successful. Meiosis and fertilization alternate in sexual life cycles. The process of meiosis produces unique reproductive cells called gametes, which have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Fertilization, the fusion of haploid gametes from two individuals, restores the diploid condition. Thus, sexually reproducing organisms alternate between haploid and diploid stages. However, the ways in which reproductive cells are produced and the timing between meiosis and fertilization vary greatly.
