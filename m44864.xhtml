Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area, and populations fluctuate based on a number of factors: seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within species. The statistical study of population dynamics, <span class="term">demography</span>, uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments. Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations. For example, <span class="term">life tables</span>, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates. In fact, while the term &#8220;demographics&#8221; is commonly used when discussing humans, all living populations can be studied using this approach.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp198531136">Population Size and Density</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp53097968">The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist, and how closely associated they are with each other. Within a particular habitat, a population can be characterized by its <span class="term">population size (<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">N</em>)</span>, the total number of individuals, and its <span class="term">population density</span>, the number of individuals within a specific area or volume. Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations. For example, populations with more individuals may be more stable than smaller populations based on their genetic variability, and thus their potential to adapt to the environment. Alternatively, a member of a population with low population density (more spread out in the habitat), might have more difficulty finding a mate to reproduce compared to a population of higher density. As is shown in <a href="/#fig-ch45_01_01" data-target-id="fig-ch45_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-idp168625840" data-class="art-connection"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Art Connection</div> <figure id="fig-ch45_01_01" data-class=" "><figcaption>Australian mammals show a typical inverse relationship between population density and body size.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-idm30151472" data-alt="Graph plots log density in kilometers squared versus log body mass in grams.

However, this method is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats. Thus, scientists usually study populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the habitat as a whole. A variety of methods can be used to sample populations to determine their size and density. For immobile organisms such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, a <span class="term">quadrat</span> may be used (<a href="/#fig-ch45_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch45_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). A quadrat is a way of marking off square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use of a wood, plastic, or metal square placed on the ground. After setting the quadrats, researchers then count the number of individuals that lie within their boundaries. Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several random locations. All of this data can then be used to estimate the population size and population density within the entire habitat. The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of organisms under study and other factors, including the density of the organism. For example, if sampling daffodils, a 1 m<sup class="sup">2</sup> quadrat might be used whereas with giant redwoods, which are larger and live much further apart from each other, a larger quadrat of 100 m<sup class="sup">2</sup> might be employed. This ensures that enough individuals of the species are counted to get an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat, including areas not sampled.</p><figure id="fig-ch45_01_02" data-class=" "><figcaption>A scientist uses a quadrat to measure population size and density.

This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population; later, a new sample is collected, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked (<a href="/#fig-ch45_01_03" data-target-id="fig-ch45_01_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch45_01_03" data-class=" "><figcaption>Mark and recapture is used to measure the population size of mobile animals such as (a) bighorn sheep, (b) the California condor, and (c) salmon.

From this, calculations are used to estimate the total population size. This method assumes that the larger the population, the lower the percentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more untagged individuals. For example, if 80 deer are captured, tagged, and released into the forest, and later 100 deer are captured and 20 of them are already marked, we can determine the population size (<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">N</em>) using the following equation:</p> <div class="equation" id="eip-704"><math data-display="block"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mtext>(number&#160;marked&#160;first&#160;catch&#160;x&#160;total&#160;number&#160;of&#160;second&#160;catch)</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>number&#160;marked&#160;second&#160;catch</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> <mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext><mi>N</mi> </mrow> </math></div><p class="para" id="fs-idp57976128">Using our example, the population size would be estimated at 400.</p> <div class="equation" id="eip-989"><math data-display="block"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mtext>(80&#160;x&#160;100)</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>20</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> <mtext>&#160;=&#160;400</mtext> </mrow> </math></div><p class="para" id="fs-idp256343120">Therefore, there are an estimated 400 total individuals in the original population.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp50673072">There are some limitations to the mark and recapture method. Some animals from the first catch may learn to avoid capture in the second round, thus inflating population estimates. Alternatively, animals may preferentially be retrapped (especially if a food reward is offered), resulting in an underestimate of population size. Also, some species may be harmed by the marking technique, reducing their survival. A variety of other techniques have been developed, including the electronic tracking of animals tagged with radio transmitters and the use of data from commercial fishing and trapping operations to estimate the size and health of populations and communities.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp220428160">Species Distribution</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm4757008">In addition to measuring simple density, further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals. <span class="term">Species dispersion patterns</span> (or distribution patterns) show the spatial relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time. In other words, they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart, and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp91292448">Individuals in a population can be more or less equally spaced apart, dispersed randomly with no predictable pattern, or clustered in groups. These are known as uniform, random, and clumped dispersion patterns, respectively (<a href="/#fig-ch45_01_04" data-target-id="fig-ch45_01_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Uniform dispersion is observed in plants that secrete substances inhibiting the growth of nearby individuals (such as the release of toxic chemicals by the sage plant <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Salvia leucophylla, </em>a phenomenon called allelopathy) and in animals like the penguin that maintain a defined territory. An example of random dispersion occurs with dandelion and other plants that have wind-dispersed seeds that germinate wherever they happen to fall in a favorable environment. A clumped dispersion may be seen in plants that drop their seeds straight to the ground, such as oak trees, or animals that live in groups (schools of fish or herds of elephants). Clumped dispersions may also be a function of habitat heterogeneity. Thus, the dispersion of the individuals within a population provides more information about how they interact with each other than does a simple density measurement. Just as lower density species might have more difficulty finding a mate, solitary species with a random distribution might have a similar difficulty when compared to social species clumped together in groups.</p> <figure id="fig-ch45_01_04" data-class=" "><figcaption>Species may have uniform, random, or clumped distribution.

Demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death rates, and life expectancies. Each of these measures, especially birth rates, may be affected by the population characteristics described above. For example, a large population size results in a higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive individuals are present. In contrast, a large population size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition, disease, and the accumulation of waste. Similarly, a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in more potential reproductive encounters between individuals, which can increase birth rate. Lastly, a female-biased sex ratio (the ratio of males to females) or age structure (the proportion of population members at specific age ranges) composed of many individuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp37440880">In addition, the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines over time. If birth and death rates are equal, the population remains stable. However, the population size will increase if birth rates exceed death rates; the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates. Life expectancy also increases the growth and decline of populations through the persisted presence of individuals remaining in the population. These demographic characteristics are often displayed in the form of a life table.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp110703760">Life Tables</h2><p class="para" id="fs-idp226912464">Life tables provide important information about the life history of an organism. Life tables divide the population into age groups and often sexes, and show how long a member of that group is likely to live. They are modeled after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy. Life tables may include the probability of individuals dying before their next birthday (i.e., their <span class="term">mortality rate</span>), the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval, and their life expectancy at each interval. An example of a life table is shown in <a href="/#tab-ch45_01_01" data-target-id="tab-ch45_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> from a study of Dall mountain sheep, a species native to northwestern North America.

Humans and most primates exhibit a Type I survivorship curve because a high percentage of offspring survive their early and middle years&#8212;death occurs predominantly in older individuals. These types of species usually have small numbers of offspring at one time, and they give a high amount of parental care to them to ensure their survival. Birds are an example of an intermediate or Type II survivorship curve because birds die more or less equally at each age interval. These organisms also may have relatively few offspring and provide significant parental care. Trees, marine invertebrates, and most fishes exhibit a Type III survivorship curve because very few of these organisms survive their younger years; however, those that make it to an old age are more likely to survive for a relatively long period of time. Organisms in this category usually have a very large number of offspring, but once they are born, little parental care is provided.
