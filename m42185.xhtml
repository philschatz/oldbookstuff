What exactly is a fluid? Can we understand fluids with the laws already presented, or will new laws emerge from their study? The physical characteristics of static or stationary fluids and some of the laws that govern their behavior are the topics of this chapter. <a href="/m42204" data-document="m42204">Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications</a> explores aspects of fluid flow.</p></body>
