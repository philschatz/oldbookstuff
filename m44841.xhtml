In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. When the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a <span class="term">gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)</span> to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release of <span class="term">follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)</span> and <span class="term">luteinizing hormone (LH)</span> from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Note that the body must reach puberty in order for the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced. Although FSH and LH are named after their functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction. Other hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp121831536">Male Hormones</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp77886272">At the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time.

Follicle cells produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. Estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both estradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp32933696">The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idp35768912">The <span class="term">ovarian cycle</span> governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the <span class="term">menstrual cycle</span> governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining.

Slowly rising levels of FSH and LH cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin releasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone. Progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure pregnancy. The trip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days. At this stage of development, called the morula, there are 30-60 cells. If pregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off. After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-idp6751792" data-class="art-connection"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Art Connection</div> <figure id="fig-ch43_04_02" data-class=" "><figcaption>The ovarian and menstrual cycles of female reproduction are regulated by hormones produced by the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-idp35680016" data-alt="Hormone levels during the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase are compared.

The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured follicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated.

FSH and LH affect reproductive structures to cause the formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for release and possible fertilization. In the male, FSH and LH stimulate Sertoli cells and interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes to facilitate sperm production. The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which also is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of males. In females, FSH and LH cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced. They regulate the female reproductive system which is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle.
