Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular matrix of bone tissue, and collagen fibers. Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes. <span class="term">Osteoclasts</span> are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei. They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix. These minerals, released from bones into the blood, help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids.

Ossification is distinct from the process of calcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues. Ossification begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. Before this time, the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. The development of bone from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous ossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. Bone growth continues until approximately age 25. Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and repair.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm174168672">Intramembranous Ossification</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm94647152"><span class="term">Intramembranous ossification</span> is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. Ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template of the future bone. They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center. Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix and deposit calcium, which hardens the matrix. The non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form around blood vessels, forming spongy bone. Connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus. The spongy bone is remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp5890240">Endochondral Ossification</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idm73220656"><span class="term">Endochondral ossification</span> is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage.

Responding to complex developmental signals, the matrix begins to calcify. This calcification prevents diffusion of nutrients into the matrix, resulting in chondrocytes dying and the opening up of cavities in the diaphysis cartilage. Blood vessels invade the cavities, and osteoblasts and osteoclasts modify the calcified cartilage matrix into spongy bone. Osteoclasts then break down some of the spongy bone to create a marrow, or medullary, cavity in the center of the diaphysis. Dense, irregular connective tissue forms a sheath (periosteum) around the bones. The periosteum assists in attaching the bone to surrounding tissues, tendons, and ligaments. The bone continues to grow and elongate as the cartilage cells at the epiphyses divide.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp83840768">In the last stage of prenatal bone development, the centers of the epiphyses begin to calcify.

Though fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform bone.

The human skeleton can be divided into long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones. Compact bone tissue is composed of osteons and forms the external layer of all bones. Spongy bone tissue is composed of trabeculae and forms the inner part of all bones. Four types of cells compose bony tissue: osteocytes, osteoclasts, osteoprogenitor cells, and osteoblasts. Ossification is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. Long bones lengthen as chondrocytes divide and secrete hyaline cartilage. Osteoblasts replace cartilage with bone. Appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bone tissue at the surface of bones. Bone remodeling involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Bone repair occurs in four stages and can take several months.</p> </div> <div class="art-exercise section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp16612208">Art Exercise</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp60350784"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm10222352"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp29363792"><a href="/#fig-ch38_02_04" data-target-id="fig-ch38_02_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>Which of the following statements about bone tissue is false?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp27807888" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">Compact bone tissue is made of cylindrical osteons that are aligned such that they travel the length of the bone.</li> <li class="item">Haversian canals contain blood vessels only.</li> <li class="item">Haversian canals contain blood vessels and nerve fibers.</li> <li class="item">Spongy tissue is found on the interior of the bone, and compact bone tissue is found on the exterior.</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp57093056"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp93249696"><a href="/#fig-ch38_02_04" data-target-id="fig-ch38_02_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>B</p> </div></div> </div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm90580528">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm138246016"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm132343824"><p class="para" id="fs-idp53891456">The Haversian canal:</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm170558896" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">is arranged as rods or plates</li> <li class="item">contains the bone&#8217;s blood vessels and nerve fibers</li> <li class="item">is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones</li> <li class="item">synthesizes and secretes matrix</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm161914032"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm53466064">B</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp39504416"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm237747072"><p class="para" id="fs-idm98583200">The epiphyseal plate:</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp59651248" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">is arranged as rods or plates</li> <li class="item">contains the bone&#8217;s blood vessels and nerve fibers</li> <li class="item">is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones</li> <li class="item">synthesizes and secretes bone matrix</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm85376384"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm82595904">C</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm163280576"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm62434544"><p class="para" id="fs-idp9009552">The cells responsible for bone resorption are ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm80271072" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">osteoclasts</li> <li class="item">osteoblasts</li> <li class="item">fibroblasts</li> <li class="item">osteocytes</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm104057408"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm73211008">A</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm120974144"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm207799616"><p class="para" id="fs-idm53742976">Compact bone is composed of ________.</p><ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm169604496" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">trabeculae</li> <li class="item">compacted collagen</li> <li class="item">osteons</li> <li class="item">calcium phosphate only</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm228216448"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm28872976">C</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="free-response section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm129931232">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm63771376"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp28739680"><p class="para" id="fs-idm139401744">What are the major differences between spongy bone and compact bone?</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm73047712"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp46610672">Compact bone tissue forms the hard external layer of all bones and consists of osteons.
