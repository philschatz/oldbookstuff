When the reproductive buds mature, they break off and become free-swimming medusa, which are either male or female (dioecious). The male medusa makes sperm, whereas the female medusa makes eggs. After fertilization, the zygote develops into a blastula, which develops into a planula larva.

The outer layer (from ectoderm) is called the <span class="term">epidermis</span> and lines the outside of the animal, whereas the inner layer (from endoderm) is called the <span class="term">gastrodermis</span> and lines the digestive cavity. Between these two membrane layers is a non-living, jelly-like <span class="term">mesoglea</span> connective layer. In terms of cellular complexity, cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer, such as nerve cells, contractile epithelial cells, enzyme-secreting cells, and nutrient-absorbing cells, as well as the presence of intercellular connections. However, the development of organs or organ systems is not advanced in this phylum.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm44834784">The nervous system is primitive, with nerve cells scattered across the body. This nerve net may show the presence of groups of cells in the form of nerve plexi (singular plexus) or nerve cords. The nerve cells show mixed characteristics of motor as well as sensory neurons. The predominant signaling molecules in these primitive nervous systems are chemical peptides, which perform both excitatory and inhibitory functions. Despite the simplicity of the nervous system, it coordinates the movement of tentacles, the drawing of captured prey to the mouth, the digestion of food, and the expulsion of waste.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm54512928">The cnidarians perform <span class="term">extracellular digestion</span> in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients. The <span class="term">gastrovascular cavity</span> has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus, which is termed an incomplete digestive system. Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment, and between cells in the gastrodermis with water in the gastrovascular cavity. The lack of a circulatory system to move dissolved gases limits the thickness of the body wall and necessitates a non-living mesoglea between the layers. There is no excretory system or organs, and nitrogenous wastes simply diffuse from the cells into the water outside the animal or in the gastrovascular cavity. There is also no circulatory system, so nutrients must move from the cells that absorb them in the lining of the gastrovascular cavity through the mesoglea to other cells.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm171088992">The phylum Cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into four classes: Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa, and Hydrozoa. The anthozoans, the sea anemones and corals, are all sessile species, whereas the scyphozoans (jellyfish) and cubozoans (box jellies) are swimming forms. The hydrozoans contain sessile forms and swimming colonial forms like the Portuguese Man O&#8217; War.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm129230992">Class Anthozoa</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm190896208">The class Anthozoa includes all cnidarians that exhibit a polyp body plan only; in other words, there is no medusa stage within their life cycle.

The slit-like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a <span class="term">siphonophore</span>. The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food, and may extend for up to two-thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity. This cavity is divided into several chambers by longitudinal septa called mesenteries. Each mesentery consists of one ectodermal and one endodermal cell layer with the mesoglea sandwiched in between. Mesenteries do not divide the gastrovascular cavity completely, and the smaller cavities coalesce at the pharyngeal opening. The adaptive benefit of the mesenteries appears to be an increase in surface area for absorption of nutrients and gas exchange.</p><p class="para" id="fs-idp66774288">Sea anemones feed on small fish and shrimp, usually by immobilizing their prey using the cnidocytes. Some sea anemones establish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab&#8217;s shell. In this relationship, the anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab, and the crab is protected from the predators by the stinging cells of the anemone. Anemone fish, or clownfish, are able to live in the anemone since they are immune to the toxins contained within the nematocysts.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm222968208">Anthozoans remain polypoid throughout their lives and can reproduce asexually by budding or fragmentation, or sexually by producing gametes.

Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. The mouth leads to the gastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, called diverticuli. In some species, the digestive system may be further branched into radial canals. Like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two functions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion; thus, more cells are in direct contact with the nutrients in the gastrovascular cavity.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm167130192">In scyphozoans, nerve cells are scattered all over the body. Neurons may even be present in clusters called rhopalia. These animals possess a ring of muscles lining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water. Scyphozoans are dioecious animals, that is, the sexes are separate. The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are expelled through the mouth. Planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form known as scyphistoma. These forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form.

They possess outer and inner tissue layers that sandwich a noncellular mesoglea. Cnidarians possess a well-formed digestive system and carry out extracellular digestion. The cnidocyte is a specialized cell for delivering toxins to prey as well as warning off predators. Cnidarians have separate sexes and have a lifecycle that involves morphologically distinct forms. These animals also show two distinct morphological forms&#8212;medusoid and polypoid&#8212;at various stages in their lifecycle.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm200229344">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm87789664"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm240788064"><p class="para" id="fs-idm8258752">Cnidocytes are found in _____.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm191289344" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">phylum Porifera</li> <li class="item">phylum Nemertea</li> <li class="item">phylum Nematoda</li> <li class="item">phylum Cnidaria</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm86389376"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm202329104">D</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm95293216"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp5149184"><p class="para" id="fs-idm100345808">Cubozoans are ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm194780880" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">polyps</li> <li class="item">medusoids</li> <li class="item">polymorphs</li> <li class="item">sponges</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm118680544"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm174152592">C</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm102636064">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm248646960"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm211518528"><p class="para" id="fs-idm166600688">Explain the function of nematocysts in cnidarians.</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm78557136"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm161973376">Nematocysts are &#8220;stinging cells&#8221; designed to paralyze prey.
