Some roots are modified to absorb moisture and exchange gases. Most roots are underground. Some plants, however, also have <span class="term">adventitious roots</span>, which emerge above the ground from the shoot.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp108729488">Types of Root Systems</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm1114688">Root systems are mainly of two types (<a href="/#fig-ch30_03_01" data-target-id="fig-ch30_03_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Dicots have a tap root system, while monocots have a fibrous root system. A <span class="term">tap root system</span> has a main root that grows down vertically, and from which many smaller lateral roots arise. Dandelions are a good example; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds, and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root). A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil. In contrast, a <span class="term">fibrous root system</span> is located closer to the soil surface, and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion (lawn grasses are a good example, as are wheat, rice, and corn). Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots. Plants that grow in dry areas often have deep root systems, whereas plants growing in areas with abundant water are likely to have shallower root systems.</p> <figure id="fig-ch30_03_01"><span class="media" id="fs-idp100476384" alt=" Top photo shows carrots, which are thick tap roots that have thin lateral roots extending from them.

When the plant embryo emerges from the seed, the radicle of the embryo forms the root system. The tip of the root is protected by the <span class="term">root cap</span>, a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure. The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil. The root tip can be divided into three zones: a zone of cell division, a zone of elongation, and a zone of maturation and differentiation (<a href="/#fig-ch30_03_02" data-target-id="fig-ch30_03_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). The zone of cell division is closest to the root tip; it is made up of the actively dividing cells of the root meristem. The zone of elongation is where the newly formed cells increase in length, thereby lengthening the root. Beginning at the first root hair is the zone of cell maturation where the root cells begin to differentiate into special cell types. All three zones are in the first centimeter or so of the root tip.</p> <figure id="fig-ch30_03_02"><span class="media" id="fs-idp93991728" alt=" This lateral section of a root tip is divided into three areas: an upper area of maturation, a middle area of elongation, and a lower area of cell division at the root tip. In the area of maturation, root hairs extend from the main root and cells are large and rectangular. The area of elongation has no root hairs, and the cells are still rectangular, but somewhat smaller. A vascular cylinder runs through the center of the root in the area of maturation and the area of elongation. In the area of cell division the cells are much smaller. Cells within this area are called the apical meristem. A layer of cells called the root cap surrounds the apical meristem."> <img src="Figure_30_03_02.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="280"/> </span> <figcaption>A longitudinal view of the root reveals the zones of cell division, elongation, and maturation.

The epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption. <span class="term">Root hairs</span>, which are extensions of root epidermal cells, increase the surface area of the root, greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp18220384">Inside the root, the ground tissue forms two regions: the cortex and the pith (<a href="/#fig-ch30_03_03" data-target-id="fig-ch30_03_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Compared to stems, roots have lots of cortex and little pith. Both regions include cells that store photosynthetic products. The cortex is between the epidermis and the vascular tissue, whereas the pith lies between the vascular tissue and the center of the root.</p> <figure id="fig-ch30_03_03"><span class="media" id="fs-idp31312992" alt=" The micrograph shows a root cross section.

Outside the cortex is the exodermis. The exodermis is about two cells thick and is made up of sclerenchyma cells that stain red.

A layer of cells known as the <span class="term">endodermis</span> separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root. The endodermis is exclusive to roots, and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root&#8217;s vascular system. A waxy substance called suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells. This waxy region, known as the <span class="term">Casparian strip</span>, forces water and solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells. This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis, while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded. The outermost cell layer of the root&#8217;s vascular tissue is the <span class="term">pericycle</span>, an area that can give rise to lateral roots. In dicot roots, the xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an X shape, whereas in monocot roots, the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith.</p> <figure id="fig-ch30_03_04"><span class="media" id="fs-idp122691760" alt=" The cross section of a dicot root has an X-shaped structure at its center.

The monocot root is similar to a dicot root, but the center of the root is filled with pith. The phloem cells form a ring around the pith. Round clusters of xylem cells are embedded in the phloem, symmetrically arranged around the central pith.

Taproots and fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots. Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot. The growing root tip is protected by a root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells). Root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some habitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots.</p> </div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp91880960">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp60672"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp5084496"><p class="para" id="fs-idp31284784">Roots that enable a plant to grow on another plant are called ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp51385936" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">epiphytic roots</li> <li class="item">prop roots</li> <li class="item">adventitious roots</li> <li class="item">aerial roots</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp1127216"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm33589888">A</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp89826256"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp219824288"><p class="para" id="fs-idp51341072">The ________ forces selective uptake of minerals in the root.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp188459152" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">pericycle</li> <li class="item">epidermis</li> <li class="item">endodermis</li> <li class="item">root cap</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm13244528"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp36727520">C</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp3441920"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp65710000"><p class="para" id="fs-idp85599984">Newly-formed root cells begin to form different cell types in the ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp120370976" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">zone of elongation</li> <li class="item">zone of maturation</li> <li class="item">root meristem</li> <li class="item">zone of cell division</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp92837536"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp130607392">B</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="free-response section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp35112976">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp131289104"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp89166544"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp70463408">Compare a tap root system with a fibrous root system.
