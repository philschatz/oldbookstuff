Populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic. The distribution of phenotypes among individuals, known as the <span class="term">population variation</span>, is influenced by a number of factors, including the population&#8217;s genetic structure and the environment (<a href="/#fig-ch19_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch19_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).

Because alleles are passed from parent to offspring, those that confer beneficial traits or behaviors may be selected for, while deleterious alleles may be selected against. Acquired traits, for the most part, are not heritable. For example, if an athlete works out in the gym every day, building up muscle strength, the athlete&#8217;s offspring will not necessarily grow up to be a body builder. If there is a genetic basis for the ability to run fast, on the other hand, this may be passed to a child.</p> <div class="interactive" id="fs-idp49678752"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-idm46935584" alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="epigenetic.png" data-mime-type="image/png" width="120"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-idm35464176">Before Darwinian evolution became the prevailing theory of the field, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck theorized that acquired traits could, in fact, be inherited; while this hypothesis has largely been unsupported, scientists have recently begun to realize that Lamarck was not completely wrong.

The greater the hereditability of a population&#8217;s phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm33908784">The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called <span class="term">genetic variance</span>. When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a population&#8217;s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can. This also helps reduce the risks associated with <span class="term">inbreeding</span>, the mating of closely related individuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease. For example, a disease that is caused by a rare, recessive allele might exist in a population, but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele. Because the allele is rare in a normal, healthy population with unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers will mate is low, and even then, only 25 percent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents. While it is likely to happen at some point, it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population, and as a result, the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool. However, if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other, this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring, a phenomenon known as <span class="term">inbreeding depression</span>.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp75088976">Changes in allele frequencies that are identified in a population can shed light on how it is evolving. In addition to natural selection, there are other evolutionary forces that could be in play: genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, nonrandom mating, and environmental variances.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp26534064">Genetic Drift</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm78896048">The theory of natural selection stems from the observation that some individuals in a population are more likely to survive longer and have more offspring than others; thus, they will pass on more of their genes to the next generation. A big, powerful male gorilla, for example, is much more likely than a smaller, weaker one to become the population&#8217;s silverback, the pack&#8217;s leader who mates far more than the other males of the group. The pack leader will father more offspring, who share half of his genes, and are likely to also grow bigger and stronger like their father. Over time, the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population, and the population will, as a result, grow larger on average. That is, this would occur if this particular <span class="term">selection pressure</span>, or driving selective force, were the only one acting on the population. In other examples, better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm30526416">Another way a population&#8217;s allele and genotype frequencies can change is <span class="term">genetic drift</span> (<a href="/#fig-ch19_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch19_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>), which is simply the effect of chance. By chance, some individuals will have more offspring than others&#8212;not due to an advantage conferred by some genetically-encoded trait, but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time (when the receptive female walked by) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (when a fox was hunting).</p> <div class="art-connection" id="fs-idm21195008"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Art Connection</div> <p class="para" id="fs-idm91336928"><figure id="fig-ch19_02_02"><span class="media" id="fs-idp67330832" alt=" A population has 10 rabbits. 2 of these rabbits are homozygous dominant for the B allele and have brown coat color. 6 are heterozygous and also have brown coat color.

In this situation, those individuals are unlikely to be representative of the entire population, which results in the founder effect. The founder effect occurs when the genetic structure changes to match that of the new population&#8217;s founding fathers and mothers. The founder effect is believed to have been a key factor in the genetic history of the Afrikaner population of Dutch settlers in South Africa, as evidenced by mutations that are common in Afrikaners but rare in most other populations. This is likely due to the fact that a higher-than-normal proportion of the founding colonists carried these mutations.

Species evolve because of the accumulation of mutations that occur over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural selection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome.

There are many reasons <span class="term">nonrandom mating</span> occurs. One reason is simple mate choice; for example, female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger, brighter tails. Traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection. One common form of mate choice, called <span class="term">assortative mating</span>, is an individual&#8217;s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm89683824">Another cause of nonrandom mating is physical location.

A beachgoer is likely to have darker skin than a city dweller, for example, due to regular exposure to the sun, an environmental factor. Some major characteristics, such as gender, are determined by the environment for some species. For example, some turtles and other reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). TSD means that individuals develop into males if their eggs are incubated within a certain temperature range, or females at a different temperature range.</p> <figure id="fig-ch19_02_05"><span class="media" id="fs-idp155463248" alt="This photo shows a person holding a baby alligator."> <img src="Figure_19_02_05.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="345"/> </span> <figcaption>The sex of the American alligator (<em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Alligator mississippiensis</em>) is determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated.

Such <span class="term">geographical variation</span> is seen between most populations and can be significant. One type of geographic variation, called a <span class="term">cline</span>, can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient. Species of warm-blooded animals, for example, tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth&#8217;s poles, allowing them to better conserve heat. This is considered a latitudinal cline. Alternatively, flowering plants tend to bloom at different times depending on where they are along the slope of a mountain, known as an altitudinal cline.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm137166592">If there is gene flow between the populations, the individuals will likely show gradual differences in phenotype along the cline.

Different alleles can confer different phenotypes, and different environments can also cause individuals to look or act differently. Only those differences encoded in an individual&#8217;s genes, however, can be passed to its offspring and, thus, be a target of natural selection. Natural selection works by selecting for alleles that confer beneficial traits or behaviors, while selecting against those for deleterious qualities. Genetic drift stems from the chance occurrence that some individuals in the germ line have more offspring than others. When individuals leave or join the population, allele frequencies can change as a result of gene flow. Mutations to an individual&#8217;s DNA may introduce new variation into a population. Allele frequencies can also be altered when individuals do not randomly mate with others in the group.</p> </div> <div class="art-exercise section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm31234096">Art Connections</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp10864432"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp49675680"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm87650416"><a href="/#fig-ch19_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch19_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> Do you think genetic drift would happen more quickly on an island or on the mainland?</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp6352560"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm72161856"><a href="/#fig-ch19_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch19_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> Genetic drift is likely to occur more rapidly on an island where smaller populations are expected to occur.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm122764112">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm20960192"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm76301648"><p class="para" id="fs-idp5436256">When male lions reach sexual maturity, they leave their group in search of a new pride.

For example, a big, powerful male gorilla is much more likely than a smaller, weaker one to become the population&#8217;s silverback: the pack&#8217;s leader who mates far more than the other males of the group. Therefore, the pack leader will father more offspring who share half of his genes and are likely to grow bigger and stronger like their father. Over time, the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population, and the average body size, as a result, grow larger on average.</p></div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp12811312"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp31648496"><p class="para" id="fs-idp56729600">Explain what a cline is and provide examples.</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm18688784"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp44918352">A cline is a type of geographic variation that is seen in populations of a given species that vary gradually across an ecological gradient. For example, warm-blooded animals tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth&#8217;s poles, allowing them to better conserve heat. This is considered a latitudinal cline. Flowering plants tend to bloom at different times depending on where they are along the slope of a mountain. This is known as an altitudinal cline.</p></div> </div> </div> </body>
