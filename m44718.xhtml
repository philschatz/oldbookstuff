Autotrophic plants can make their own food from inorganic raw materials, such as carbon dioxide and water, through photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight. Green plants are included in this group. Some plants, however, are heterotrophic: they are totally parasitic and lacking in chlorophyll. These plants, referred to as holo-parasitic plants, are unable to synthesize organic carbon and draw all of their nutrients from the host plant.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm38767216">Plants may also enlist the help of microbial partners in nutrient acquisition. Particular species of bacteria and fungi have evolved along with certain plants to create a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with roots. This improves the nutrition of both the plant and the microbe. The formation of nodules in legume plants and mycorrhization can be considered among the nutritional adaptations of plants. However, these are not the only type of adaptations that we may find; many plants have other adaptations that allow them to thrive under specific conditions.</p> <div class="interactive" id="fs-idm82362208"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-idp30410288" alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="basic_photosyn.png" data-mime-type="image/jpeg" width="120"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-idp84831424">This <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/basic_photosyn" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/basic_photosyn">video</a> reviews basic concepts about photosynthesis.

Atmospheric nitrogen, which is the diatomic molecule N<sub class="sub">2,</sub> or dinitrogen, is the largest pool of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. However, plants cannot take advantage of this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes to convert it into biologically useful forms. However, nitrogen can be &#8220;fixed,&#8221; which means that it can be converted to ammonia (NH<sub class="sub">3</sub>) through biological, physical, or chemical processes. As you have learned, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub class="sub">2</sub>) into ammonia (NH<sub class="sub">3</sub>), exclusively carried out by prokaryotes such as soil bacteria or cyanobacteria. Biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture. The following equation represents the process:</p><div class="equation" id="eip-196"> <math display="block"> <mrow> <msub> <mtext>N</mtext> <mn>2</mn> </msub> <mo>+</mo><mn>16</mn><mtext>&#160;ATP&#160;</mtext><mo>+</mo><msup> <mrow> <mtext>&#160;8&#160;e</mtext> </mrow> <mo>&#8722;</mo> </msup> <mtext>&#160;</mtext><mo>+</mo><msup> <mrow> <mtext>&#160;8&#160;H</mtext> </mrow> <mo>+</mo> </msup> <mtext>&#160;</mtext><mo stretchy="false">&#8594;</mo><msub> <mrow> <mtext>&#160;2NH</mtext> </mrow> <mn>3</mn> </msub> <mtext>&#160;</mtext><mo>+</mo><mtext>&#160;16&#160;ADP&#160;</mtext><mo>+</mo><mtext>&#160;16&#160;Pi&#160;</mtext><mo>+</mo><msub> <mrow> <mtext>&#160;H</mtext> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msub> </mrow> </math> </div> <p class="para" id="fs-idm71823664">The most important source of BNF is the symbiotic interaction between soil bacteria and legume plants, including many crops important to humans (<a href="/#fig-ch31_03_01" data-target-id="fig-ch31_03_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).

This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, by means of the enzyme <span class="term">nitrogenase</span>. Therefore, using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants, as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource, such as natural gas. Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen from the atmosphere. The process simultaneously contributes to soil fertility because the plant root system leaves behind some of the biologically available nitrogen. As in any symbiosis, both organisms benefit from the interaction: the plant obtains ammonia, and bacteria obtain carbon compounds generated through photosynthesis, as well as a protected niche in which to grow (<a href="/#fig-ch31_03_02" data-target-id="fig-ch31_03_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch31_03_02"><span class="media" id="fs-idm64165648" alt=" Part A is a photo of legume roots, which are long and thin with hair-like appendages.

These conditions are very common; therefore, most plants rely on fungi to facilitate the uptake of minerals from the soil. Fungi form symbiotic associations called mycorrhizae with plant roots, in which the fungi actually are integrated into the physical structure of the root. The fungi colonize the living root tissue during active plant growth.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm58935600">Through mycorrhization, the plant obtains mainly phosphate and other minerals, such as zinc and copper, from the soil. The fungus obtains nutrients, such as sugars, from the plant root (<a href="/#fig-ch31_03_03" data-target-id="fig-ch31_03_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Mycorrhizae help increase the surface area of the plant root system because hyphae, which are narrow, can spread beyond the nutrient depletion zone. Hyphae can grow into small soil pores that allow access to phosphorus that would otherwise be unavailable to the plant. The beneficial effect on the plant is best observed in poor soils. The benefit to fungi is that they can obtain up to 20 percent of the total carbon accessed by plants. Mycorrhizae functions as a physical barrier to pathogens. It also provides an induction of generalized host defense mechanisms, and sometimes involves production of antibiotic compounds by the fungi.</p><figure id="fig-ch31_03_03"><span class="media" id="fs-idm110735488" alt=" Photo shows a root with many branching tips.

Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath around the roots, called a mantle. Hyphae from the fungi extend from the mantle into the soil, which increases the surface area for water and mineral absorption. This type of mycorrhizae is found in forest trees, especially conifers, birches, and oaks. Endomycorrhizae, also called arbuscular mycorrhizae, do not form a dense sheath over the root. Instead, the fungal mycelium is embedded within the root tissue. Endomycorrhizae are found in the roots of more than 80 percent of terrestrial plants.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm13521920">Nutrients from Other Sources</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm112425152">Some plants cannot produce their own food and must obtain their nutrition from outside sources.

An example of this is the dodder (<a href="/#fig-ch31_03_04" data-target-id="fig-ch31_03_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>), which has a weak, cylindrical stem that coils around the host and forms suckers. From these suckers, cells invade the host stem and grow to connect with the vascular bundles of the host. The parasitic plant obtains water and nutrients through these connections. The plant is a total parasite (a holoparasite) because it is completely dependent on its host. Other parasitic plants (hemiparasites) are fully photosynthetic and only use the host for water and minerals. There are about 4,100 species of parasitic plants.</p><figure id="fig-ch31_03_04"><span class="media" id="fs-idp43334176" alt=" Photo shows a beige vine with small white flowers.

Most saprophytes do not directly digest dead matter: instead, they parasitize fungi that digest dead matter, or are mycorrhizal, ultimately obtaining photosynthate from a fungus that derived photosynthate from its host. Saprophytic plants are uncommon; only a few species are described.</p> <figure id="fig-ch31_03_05"><span class="media" id="fs-idp39724192" alt=" Photo shows a plant with light pink stems reminiscent of asparagus.
