An <span class="term">electrolyte</span> is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water. A <span class="term">non-electrolyte</span>, in contrast, doesn&#8217;t dissociate into ions during water dissolution. Both electrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance. The body&#8217;s fluids include blood plasma, the cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body. The membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) are <span class="term">semi-permeable membranes</span>. Semi-permeable membranes are permeable (or permissive) to certain types of solutes and water. Solutions on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by movement of solutes and/or water across the membrane. As seen in <a href="/#fig-ch41_01_01" data-target-id="fig-ch41_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, a cell placed in water tends to swell due to gain of water from the hypotonic or &#8220;low salt&#8221; environment. A cell placed in a solution with higher salt concentration, on the other hand, tends to make the membrane shrivel up due to loss of water into the hypertonic or &#8220;high salt&#8221; environment. Isotonic cells have an equal concentration of solutes inside and outside the cell; this equalizes the osmotic pressure on either side of the cell membrane which is a semi-permeable membrane.</p> <figure id="fig-ch41_01_01" data-class=" "><figcaption>Cells placed in a hypertonic environment tend to shrink due to loss of water.

There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system. While osmoregulation is achieved across membranes within the body, excess electrolytes and wastes are transported to the kidneys and excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp54127232">Need for Osmoregulation</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp6024352">Biological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food and water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or when a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire consequences.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm11703344">Mammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific concentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular fluid. Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid compartments can also change temporarily. Because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a direct bearing on blood pressure.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp160208656">Transport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm22780000">Osmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is directly proportional to the number of atoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules. Non-electrolyte solute molecules, like glucose, do not dissociate into smaller units when dissolved in water. Electrolyte solutes, like sodium chloride, &#8220;ionize&#8221;: they dissociate into sodium and chloride ions when dissolved in water and they become charged particles, or ions. The most important ions, whose concentrations are very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (Na<sup class="sup">+</sup>), potassium (K<sup class="sup">+</sup>), calcium (Ca<sup class="sup">+2</sup>), magnesium (Mg<sup class="sup">+2</sup>), and the anions chloride (Cl<sup class="sup">-</sup>), carbonate (CO<sub class="sub">3</sub>), bicarbonate (HCO<sub class="sub">3</sub><sup class="sup">-</sup>), and phosphate (PO<sub class="sub">4</sub><sup class="sup">-</sup>). Because salts dissociate into the component ions, they have a greater effect on osmotic pressure than non-electrolyte solutes. Salts are lost from the body during urination and perspiration. For this reason, athletes are encouraged to replace electrolytes along with fluids during periods of increased activity and perspiration.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp192669184">Water can pass through membranes by passive diffusion. If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it would be impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special mechanisms to cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body. This movement can be accomplished by facilitated diffusion and active transport. Facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute. Active transport requires energy in the form of ATP conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration gradient.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp85228080">Concept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp16230720">In order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured. The unit for measuring solutes is the <span class="term">mole</span>. One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute. For example, the molecular weight of sodium chloride is 58.44. Thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams. The <span class="term">molarity</span> of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The <span class="term">molality</span> of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. If the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water. While molarity and molality are used to express the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L): the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on the ion. The unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes form ions in aqueous solutions) and the charge on the ions.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp105917248">Thus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole. For ions that have a charge of two (like calcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles. Another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is the milliosmole (mOsm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent. Body fluids are usually maintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm71869712">Osmoregulators and Osmoconformers</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp149727408">Persons lost at sea without any fresh water to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt to drinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either freshwater or seawater. They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. It is possible, however, for a few fishes like salmon to spend part of their life in fresh water and part in sea water. Organisms like the salmon and molly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms. This is possible because some fish have evolved <span class="term">osmoregulatory</span> mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments. When they live in fresh water, their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic, as illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch41_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch41_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" data-effect="bold">a</strong>. In such hypotonic environments, these fish do not drink much water. Instead, they pass a lot of very dilute urine, and they achieve electrolyte balance by active transport of salts through the gills. When they move to a hypertonic marine environment, these fish start drinking sea water; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine, as illustrated in <a href="/#fig-ch41_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch41_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" data-effect="bold">b</strong>. Most marine invertebrates, on the other hand, may be isotonic with sea water (<span class="term">osmoconformers</span>). Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration. Cartilaginous fishes&#8217; salt composition of the blood is similar to bony fishes; however, the blood of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). This does not mean that their electrolyte composition is similar to that of sea water. They achieve isotonicity with the sea by storing large concentrations of urea. These animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals. TMAO stabilizes proteins in the presence of high urea levels, preventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other animals exposed to similar levels of urea. Sharks are cartilaginous fish with a rectal gland to secrete salt and assist in osmoregulation.</p> <figure id="fig-ch41_01_02" data-class=" "><figcaption>Fish are osmoregulators, but must use different mechanisms to survive in (a) freshwater or (b) saltwater environments.

When kidney function fails, dialysis must be done to artificially rid the body of wastes. This is a vital process to keep patients alive. In some cases, the patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are eligible for a kidney transplant. In others who are not candidates for kidney transplants, dialysis is a life-long necessity.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp85844528">Dialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and clinics. While some roles in this field include equipment development and maintenance, most dialysis technicians work in direct patient care. Their on-the-job duties, which typically occur under the direct supervision of a registered nurse, focus on providing dialysis treatments. This can include reviewing patient history and current condition, assessing and responding to patient needs before and during treatment, and monitoring the dialysis process. Treatment may include taking and reporting a patient&#8217;s vital signs and preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate and sterile procedures.</p> </div></div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm13993872">Section Summary</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp68024336">Solute concentrations across a semi-permeable membranes influence the movement of water and solutes across the membrane. It is the number of solute molecules and not the molecular size that is important in osmosis. Osmoregulation and osmotic balance are important bodily functions, resulting in water and salt balance. Not all solutes can pass through a semi-permeable membrane. Osmosis is the movement of water across the membrane. Osmosis occurs to equalize the number of solute molecules across a semi-permeable membrane by the movement of water to the side of higher solute concentration. Facilitated diffusion utilizes protein channels to move solute molecules from areas of higher to lower concentration while active transport mechanisms are required to move solutes against concentration gradients. Osmolarity is measured in units of milliequivalents or milliosmoles, both of which take into consideration the number of solute particles and the charge on them. Fish that live in fresh water or saltwater adapt by being osmoregulators or osmoconformers.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp170228272">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm76593808"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp244239504"><p class="para" id="fs-idp28925904">When a dehydrated human patient needs to be given fluids intravenously, he or she is given:</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp57701328" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">water, which is hypotonic with respect to body fluids</li> <li class="item">saline at a concentration that is isotonic with respect to body fluids</li> <li class="item">glucose because it is a non-electrolyte</li> <li class="item">blood</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp175448112"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp71114464">B</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm2578240"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp141888016"><p class="para" id="fs-idp13725200">The sodium ion is at the highest concentration in:</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm18534240" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">intracellular fluid</li> <li class="item">extracellular fluid</li> <li class="item">blood plasma</li> <li class="item">none of the above</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm51466192"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm52405152">B</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp206826416"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp150849552"><p class="para" id="fs-idp84793600">Cells in a hypertonic solution tend to:</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp73104720" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">shrink due to water loss</li> <li class="item">swell due to water gain</li> <li class="item">stay the same size due to water moving into and out of the cell at the same rate</li> <li class="item">none of the above</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp148922160"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp72295120">A</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm17911008">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm46483664"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm22902160"><p class="para" id="fs-idp97189760">Why is excretion important in order to achieve osmotic balance?</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm13893552"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp249643504">Excretion allows an organism to rid itself of waste molecules that could be toxic if allowed to accumulate.
