All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use up almost 25 percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function.

They are surrounded by three layers and are made up internally of three distinct regions&#8212;the cortex, medulla, and pelvis.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm33870112">The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. The renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where they further divide into segmental, interlobar, arcuate, and cortical radiate arteries.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm104668096">The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. The nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. Cortical nephrons are found in the renal cortex, while juxtamedullary nephrons are found in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. The nephron filters and exchanges water and solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm195125680">There are three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular filtration, which occurs in the glomerulus; tubular reabsorption, which occurs in the renal tubules; and tubular secretion, which also occurs in the renal tubules.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm105582864">Art Connections</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp35054880"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm190575152"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm256209328"><a href="/#fig-ch41_03_02" data-target-id="fig-ch41_03_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> Which of the following statements about the kidney is false?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm119323520" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">The renal pelvis drains into the ureter.</li> <li class="item">The renal pyramids are in the medulla.</li> <li class="item">The cortex covers the capsule.</li> <li class="item">Nephrons are in the renal cortex.</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm140465200"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm183172528"><a href="/#fig-ch41_03_02" data-target-id="fig-ch41_03_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> C</p></div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm256548544"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp27610192"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm34660640"><a href="/#fig-ch41_03_03" data-target-id="fig-ch41_03_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> Which of the following statements about the nephron is false?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm204336" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">The collecting duct empties into the distal convoluted tubule.</li> <li class="item">The Bowman&#8217;s capsule surrounds the glomerulus.</li> <li class="item">The loop of Henle is between the proximal and distal convoluted tubules.</li> <li class="item">The loop of Henle empties into the distal convoluted tubule.</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idm98057744"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm155509168"><a href="/#fig-ch41_03_03" data-target-id="fig-ch41_03_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> A</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp4146096"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idm169056288"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm123604960"><a href="/#fig-ch41_03_05" data-target-id="fig-ch41_03_05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> Loop diuretics are drugs sometimes used to treat hypertension.
