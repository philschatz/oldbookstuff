The convex lens shown has been shaped so that all light rays that enter it parallel to its axis cross one another at a single point on the opposite side of the lens.

An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown, to illustrate how the ray changes direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens. Since the index of refraction of the lens is greater than that of air, the ray moves towards the perpendicular as it enters and away from the perpendicular as it leaves.

In other cases, the image is less obvious. Where, for example, is the image formed by eyeglasses? We will use ray tracing for thin lenses to illustrate how they form images, and we will develop equations to describe the image formation quantitatively.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id2678316">Consider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown in <a href="#import-auto-id2631957" data-target-id="import-auto-id2631957" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>. To find the location and size of the image formed, we trace the paths of selected light rays originating from one point on the object, in this case the top of the person&#8217;s head. The figure shows three rays from the top of the object that can be traced using the ray tracing rules given above. (Rays leave this point going in many directions, but we concentrate on only a few with paths that are easy to trace.) The first ray is one that enters the lens parallel to its axis and passes through the focal point on the other side (rule 1). The second ray passes through the center of the lens without changing direction (rule 3). The third ray passes through the nearer focal point on its way into the lens and leaves the lens parallel to its axis (rule 4). The three rays cross at the same point on the other side of the lens. The image of the top of the person&#8217;s head is located at this point. All rays that come from the same point on the top of the person&#8217;s head are refracted in such a way as to cross at the point shown. Rays from another point on the object, such as her belt buckle, will also cross at another common point, forming a complete image, as shown. Although three rays are traced in <a href="#import-auto-id2631957" data-target-id="import-auto-id2631957" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>, only two are necessary to locate the image. It is best to trace rays for which there are simple ray tracing rules. Before applying ray tracing to other situations, let us consider the example shown in <a href="#import-auto-id2631957" data-target-id="import-auto-id2631957" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> in more detail.</p> <figure id="import-auto-id2631957"><figcaption>Ray tracing is used to locate the image formed by a lens.

Rays coming from a common point on the object continue to diverge after passing through the lens, but all appear to originate from a point at the location of the image. The image is on the same side of the lens as the object and is farther away from the lens than the object. This image, like all case 2 images, cannot be projected and, hence, is called a <span class="term" id="import-auto-id2702624">virtual image</span>. Light rays only appear to originate at a virtual image; they do not actually pass through that location in space. A screen placed at the location of a virtual image will receive only diffuse light from the object, not focused rays from the lens. Additionally, a screen placed on the opposite side of the lens will receive rays that are still diverging, and so no image will be projected on it. We can see the magnified image with our eyes, because the lens of the eye converges the rays into a real image projected on our retina. Finally, we note that a virtual image is upright and larger than the object, meaning that the magnification is positive and greater than 1.</p> <figure id="import-auto-id2998230"><figcaption>Ray tracing predicts the image location and size for an object held closer to a converging lens than its focal length. Ray 1 enters parallel to the axis and exits through the focal point on the opposite side, while ray 2 passes through the center of the lens without changing path. The two rays continue to diverge on the other side of the lens, but both appear to come from a common point, locating the upright, magnified, virtual image.

These are referred to as case 1, 2, and 3 images. Convex (converging) lenses can form either real or virtual images (cases 1 and 2, respectively), whereas concave (diverging) lenses can form only virtual images (always case 3). Real images are always inverted, but they can be either larger or smaller than the object. For example, a slide projector forms an image larger than the slide, whereas a camera makes an image smaller than the object being photographed. Virtual images are always upright and cannot be projected. Virtual images are larger than the object only in case 2, where a convex lens is used. The virtual image produced by a concave lens is always smaller than the object&#8212;a case 3 image. We can see and photograph virtual images only by using an additional lens to form a real image.</p> <table id="import-auto-id3075384" summary="THREE TYPES OF IMAGES FORMED BY THIN LENSES"><caption><span class="title">Three Types of Images Formed By Thin Lenses</span></caption><thead><tr> <td>Type</td> <td>Formed when</td> <td>Image type</td> <td><em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">d</em><sub class="sub">i</sub> </td> <td><em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">m</em></td> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td>Case 1</td> <td><math data-display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{f} {}</annotation></semantics></math> positive, <math data-display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><mtext>o</mtext></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">&gt;</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{d rSub { size 8{o} } &gt;f} {}</annotation></semantics></math></td> <td>real</td> <td>positive</td> <td>negative</td> </tr><tr> <td>Case 2</td> <td><math data-display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{f} {}</annotation></semantics></math> positive, <math data-display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><mtext>o</mtext></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">&lt;</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{d rSub { size 8{o} } &lt;f} {}</annotation></semantics></math></td> <td>virtual</td> <td>negative</td> <td>positive <math data-display="block"> <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mrow> <mi>m</mi> <mo stretchy="false">&gt;</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> </math> </td> </tr><tr> <td>Case 3</td> <td><math data-display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{f} {}</annotation></semantics></math> negative</td> <td>virtual</td> <td>negative</td> <td>positive <math data-display="block"> <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mrow> <mi>m</mi> <mo stretchy="false">&lt;</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </mrow> <mrow/> </mrow> <annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{m&lt;1} {}</annotation> </semantics> </math> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2966113">In <a href="/m42474" data-document="m42474">Image Formation by Mirrors</a>, we shall see that mirrors can form exactly the same types of images as lenses.</p><div class="note" id="fs-id2914346"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Take-Home Experiment: Concentrating Sunlight</div> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id2542076">Find several lenses and determine whether they are converging or diverging.
