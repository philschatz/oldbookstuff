Humans have five special senses: olfaction (smell), gustation (taste), equilibrium (balance and body position), vision, and hearing. Additionally, we possess general senses, also called somatosensation, which respond to stimuli like temperature, pain, pressure, and vibration. <span class="term">Vestibular sensation</span>, which is an organism&#8217;s sense of spatial orientation and balance, <span class="term">proprioception</span> (position of bones, joints, and muscles), and the sense of limb position that is used to track <span class="term">kinesthesia</span> (limb movement) are part of somatosensation. Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different, all share a common function: to convert a stimulus (such as light, or sound, or the position of the body) into an electrical signal in the nervous system. This process is called <span class="term">sensory transduction</span>.</p><p class="para" id="fs-idp111589088">There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction. In one, a neuron works with a <span class="term">sensory receptor</span>, a cell, or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus. Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron, which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system. In the second type of sensory transduction, a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment: this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor. Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli, thus showing little receptor specificity. For example, pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by temperature changes, chemical stimulation, or pressure.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp93566032">Reception</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp166398320">The first step in sensation is <span class="term">reception</span>, which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli (being bent or squished, for example), chemicals, or temperature. The receptor can then respond to the stimuli. The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus, be it far away or in contact with the body, is that receptor&#8217;s <span class="term">receptive</span> <span class="term">field</span>. Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses. For the sense of touch, a stimulus must come into contact with body. For the sense of hearing, a stimulus can be a moderate distance away (some baleen whale sounds can propagate for many kilometers). For vision, a stimulus can be very far away; for example, the visual system perceives light from stars at enormous distances.</p></div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp44066992">Transduction</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm23928880">The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. This takes place at the sensory receptor, and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the <span class="term">receptor potential</span>. How is sensory input, such as pressure on the skin, changed to a receptor potential? In this example, a type of receptor called a <span class="term">mechanoreceptor</span> (as shown in <a href="/#fig-ch36_01_01" data-target-id="fig-ch36_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure. Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron, changing its electrical potential. Recall that in the nervous system, a positive change of a neuron&#8217;s electrical potential (also called the membrane potential), depolarizes the neuron. Receptor potentials are graded potentials: the magnitude of these graded (receptor) potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus. If the magnitude of depolarization is sufficient (that is, if membrane potential reaches a threshold), the neuron will fire an action potential. In most cases, the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction, although for some receptors, such as those in the visual system, this is not always the case.</p> <figure id="fig-ch36_01_01"><figcaption>(a) Mechanosensitive ion channels are gated ion channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the plasma membrane.

For example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are each activated by different stimuli. Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or pressure. However, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our sense of taste.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp69084640">Encoding and Transmission of Sensory Information</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idp78590960">Four aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in the receptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus. Thus, action potentials transmitted over a sensory receptor&#8217;s afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other sensory circuits. For example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own dedicated system, and electrical activity in the axons of the auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulus&#8212;a sound.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp171530400">The intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor. Thus, an intense stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate of production of action potentials. A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated. An intense stimulus might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer receptors. Integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS, and the brain will further process incoming signals.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp99711392">Perception</h1><p class="para" id="fs-idp117925824"> <span class="term">Perception</span> is an individual&#8217;s interpretation of a sensation. Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors, perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor, but at higher levels in the nervous system, in the brain. The brain distinguishes sensory stimuli through a sensory pathway: action potentials from sensory receptors travel along neurons that are dedicated to a particular stimulus. These neurons are dedicated to that particular stimulus and synapse with particular neurons in the brain or spinal cord.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp103757536">All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, are transmitted though the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex. Recall that the thalamus is a structure in the forebrain that serves as a clearinghouse and relay station for sensory (as well as motor) signals. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex (<a href="/#fig-ch36_01_02" data-target-id="fig-ch36_01_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>) dedicated to processing that particular sense.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp40037520">How are neural signals interpreted? Interpretation of sensory signals between individuals of the same species is largely similar, owing to the inherited similarity of their nervous systems; however, there are some individual differences. A good example of this is individual tolerances to a painful stimulus, such as dental pain, which certainly differ.</p> <figure id="fig-ch36_01_02"><figcaption>In humans, with the exception of olfaction, all sensory signals are routed from the (a) thalamus to (b) final processing regions in the cortex of the brain.

For example, you could choose 10 percent increments between one and two pounds (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and so on) or 20 percent increments (1.2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8).</p><p class="para" id="fs-idp56639968"><strong class="emphasis">Hypothesis:</strong> Develop a hypothesis about JND in terms of percentage of the whole weight being tested (such as &#8220;the JND between the two small bags and between the two large bags is proportionally the same,&#8221; or &#8220;. . . is not proportionally the same.&#8221;) So, for the first hypothesis, if the JND between the one-pound bag and a larger bag is 0.2 pounds (that is, 20 percent; 1.0 pound feels the same as 1.1 pounds, but 1.0 pound feels less than 1.2 pounds), then the JND between the 20-pound bag and a larger bag will also be 20 percent.
