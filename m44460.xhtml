The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes, some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles. Eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis.</p> <figure id="fig-ch10_02_03"> <span class="media" id="fs-id1879663" alt="This illustration shows two sister chromatids.

In animal cells, a ring of actin fibers is formed around the periphery of the cell at the former metaphase plate (cleavage furrow). The actin ring contracts inward, pulling the plasma membrane toward the center of the cell until the cell is pinched in two. In plant cells, a new cell wall must be formed between the daughter cells. Due to the rigid cell walls of the parent cell, contraction of the middle of the cell is not possible. Instead, a phragmoplast first forms. Subsequently, a cell plate is formed in the center of the cell at the former metaphase plate. The cell plate is formed from Golgi vesicles that contain enzymes, proteins, and glucose. The vesicles fuse and the enzymes build a new cell wall from the proteins and glucose. The cell plate grows toward and eventually fuses with the cell wall of the parent cell.</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1234957"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1239382"><p class="para" id="fs-id1421377">List some reasons why a cell that has just completed cytokinesis might enter the G<sub class="sub">0</sub> phase instead of the G<sub class="sub">1</sub> phase.</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1469670"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1889801">Many cells temporarily enter G<sub class="sub">0</sub> until they reach maturity.
