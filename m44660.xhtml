Some of these questions include the following: How long have animals existed on Earth? What were the earliest members of the animal kingdom, and what organism was their common ancestor? While animal diversity increased during the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic era, 530 million years ago, modern fossil evidence suggests that primitive animal species existed much earlier.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm154943648">Pre-Cambrian Animal Life</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm155872208">The time before the Cambrian period is known as the <span class="term">Ediacaran period</span> (from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years ago), the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era (<a href="/#fig-ch27_04_01" data-target-id="fig-ch27_04_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). It is believed that early animal life, termed Ediacaran biota, evolved from protists at this time. Some protest species called choanoflagellates closely resemble the choanocyte cells in the simplest animals, sponges. In addition to their morphological similarity, molecular analyses have revealed similar sequence homologies in their DNA.</p> <figure id="fig-ch27_04_01"><span class="media" id="fs-idm167446976" alt="Table A describes eras in earth&#8217;s history. The earth&#8217;s history is divided into four eons, the Pre-Archean, Archaea, Proteozoic, Phanerozoic. The oldest eon, the Pre-Archean, spans the beginning of earth&#8217;s history to about 3.8 billion years ago. The Archean eon spans 2.5 to 3.8 billion years ago, and the Proterozoic spans 570 million to 2.5 billion years ago. The Pharenozoic eon, from 570 million years ago to present time, is sub-divided into the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The Paleozoic era, from 240 to 570 million years ago, is further divided into seven periods: the Cambrian from 500 to 570 million years ago, the Ordovician from 435 to 500 million years ago, the Silurian from 410 to 435 million years ago, the Devonian from 360 to 410 million years ago, the Missisippian from 330 to 360 million years ago, the Pennsylvanian from 290 to 330 million years ago, and the Permian from 240 to 290 million years ago. The Mesozoic era, from 66 to 240 million years ago, is divided into three periods, the Triassic from 205 to 240 million years ago, the Jurassic from 138 to 205 million years ago, and the Cretaceous, from 66 to 138 million years ago. The Cenozoic era, from 66 million years ago to modern times, is divided into two eras, the Tertiary and the Quaternary. The tertiary period spans 66 to 1.6 million years ago. The quaternary period spans 1.6 million years ago to modern times.

Echinoderms, mollusks, worms, arthropods, and chordates arose during this period. One of the most dominant species during the Cambrian period was the trilobite, an arthropod that was among the first animals to exhibit a sense of vision (<a href="/#fig-ch27_04_04abcd" data-target-id="fig-ch27_04_04abcd" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" effect="bold">abcd</strong>).</p><figure id="fig-ch27_04_03"><span class="media" id="fs-idm110475328" alt="The illustration shows a sea bed abundant with odd organisms, including tube-shaped worms anchored to the sea floor and animals that resemble cockroaches crawling along it.

There are many theories that attempt to answer this question. Environmental changes may have created a more suitable environment for animal life. Examples of these changes include rising atmospheric oxygen levels and large increases in oceanic calcium concentrations that preceded the Cambrian period (<a href="/#fig-ch27_04_05" data-target-id="fig-ch27_04_05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Some scientists believe that an expansive, continental shelf with numerous shallow lagoons or pools provided the necessary living space for larger numbers of different types of animals to co-exist. There is also support for theories that argue that ecological relationships between species, such as changes in the food web, competition for food and space, and predator-prey relationships, were primed to promote a sudden massive coevolution of species. Yet other theories claim genetic and developmental reasons for the Cambrian explosion. The morphological flexibility and complexity of animal development afforded by the evolution of <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Hox </em>control genes may have provided the necessary opportunities for increases in possible animal morphologies at the time of the Cambrian period. Theories that attempt to explain why the Cambrian explosion happened must be able to provide valid reasons for the massive animal diversification, as well as explain why it happened <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">when </em>it did. There is evidence that both supports and refutes each of the theories described above, and the answer may very well be a combination of these and other theories.</p> <figure id="fig-ch27_04_05"><span class="media" id="fs-idm100272912" alt="The chart shows the percent oxygen by volume in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Until 625 million years ago, there was virtually no oxygen. Oxygen levels began to rapidly climb around this time, and peaked around 275 million years ago, at about 35 percent. Between 275 and 225 million years ago, oxygen levels dropped precipitously to about 15 percent, and then climbed again and dropped to the modern-day concentration of 22 percent."> <img src="Figure_27_04_05f.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="430"/> </span> <figcaption>The oxygen concentration in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere rose sharply around 300 million years ago.</figcaption></figure><p class="para" id="fs-idm124748992">However, unresolved questions about the animal diversification that took place during the Cambrian period remain. For example, we do not understand how the evolution of so many species occurred in such a short period of time. Was there really an &#8220;explosion&#8221; of life at this particular time? Some scientists question the validity of the this idea, because there is increasing evidence to suggest that more animal life existed prior to the Cambrian period and that other similar species&#8217; so-called explosions (or radiations) occurred later in history as well. Furthermore, the vast diversification of animal species that appears to have begun during the Cambrian period continued well into the following Ordovician period. Despite some of these arguments, most scientists agree that the Cambrian period marked a time of impressively rapid animal evolution and diversification that is unmatched elsewhere during history.</p> <div class="interactive" id="fs-idm157461856"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-idm146296128" alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="ocean_life.png" data-mime-type="image/png" width="120"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-idm189104608">View an <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ocean_life" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ocean_life">animation</a> of what ocean life may have been like during the Cambrian explosion.</p> </div></div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm179137120">Post-Cambrian Evolution and Mass Extinctions</h1><p class="para" id="fs-idm201200816">The periods that followed the Cambrian during the Paleozoic Era are marked by further animal evolution and the emergence of many new orders, families, and species. As animal phyla continued to diversify, new species adapted to new ecological niches. During the Ordovician period, which followed the Cambrian period, plant life first appeared on land. This change allowed formerly aquatic animal species to invade land, feeding directly on plants or decaying vegetation. Continual changes in temperature and moisture throughout the remainder of the Paleozoic Era due to continental plate movements encouraged the development of new adaptations to terrestrial existence in animals, such as limbed appendages in amphibians and epidermal scales in reptiles.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm206978416">Changes in the environment often create new niches (living spaces) that contribute to rapid speciation and increased diversity. On the other hand, cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life, can result in devastating losses of diversity. Such periods of <span class="term">mass extinction</span> (<a href="/#fig-ch27_04_06" data-target-id="fig-ch27_04_06" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life, erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind. The end of the Permian period (and the Paleozoic Era) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth&#8217;s history, a loss of roughly 95 percent of the extant species at that time. Some of the dominant phyla in the world&#8217;s oceans, such as the trilobites, disappeared completely. On land, the disappearance of some dominant species of Permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles to emerge, the dinosaurs. The warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing Mesozoic Era promoted an explosive diversification of dinosaurs into every conceivable niche in land, air, and water. Plants, too, radiated into new landscapes and empty niches, creating complex communities of producers and consumers, some of which became very large on the abundant food available.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm144982320">Another mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period, bringing the Mesozoic Era to an end. Skies darkened and temperatures fell as a large meteor impact and tons of volcanic ash blocked incoming sunlight. Plants died, herbivores and carnivores starved, and the mostly cold-blooded dinosaurs ceded their dominance of the landscape to more warm-blooded mammals. In the following Cenozoic Era, mammals radiated into terrestrial and aquatic niches once occupied by dinosaurs, and birds, the warm-blooded offshoots of one line of the ruling reptiles, became aerial specialists. The appearance and dominance of flowering plants in the Cenozoic Era created new niches for insects, as well as for birds and mammals. Changes in animal species diversity during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic were also promoted by a dramatic shift in Earth&#8217;s geography, as continental plates slid over the crust into their current positions, leaving some animal groups isolated on islands and continents, or separated by mountain ranges or inland seas from other competitors. Early in the Cenozoic, new ecosystems appeared, with the evolution of grasses and coral reefs. Late in the Cenozoic, further extinctions followed by speciation occurred during ice ages that covered high latitudes with ice and then retreated, leaving new open spaces for colonization.</p> <div class="interactive" id="fs-idm147951600"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-idm172450432" alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="mass_extinction.png" data-mime-type="image/png" width="120"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-idm175875152">Watch the following <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/mass_extinction" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/mass_extinction">video</a> to learn more about the mass extinctions.</p></div><figure id="fig-ch27_04_06"><span class="media" id="fs-idm193821008" alt="The chart shows percent extinction intensity versus time in millions of years before present.

A paleontologist&#8217;s work may involve field studies: searching for and studying fossils.

However, recent fossil discoveries have revealed that additional, larger, and more complex animals existed during the Ediacaran period, and even possibly earlier, during the Cryogenian period.
